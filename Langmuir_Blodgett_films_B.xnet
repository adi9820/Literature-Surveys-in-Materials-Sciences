"For the first time, conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films with reasonably low resistivity (10–50 Ω cm) have been obtained (N-docosylpyridinium-TCNQ-iodine ternary salts). These two-dimensional polycrystalline films behave as low-resistivity organic semiconductors. The aim of this paper is to determine the intrinsic nature of these films. As far as the electrical characterization is concerned, the Hall effect can hardly be used because of the very high internal resistance of the films. Furthermore, because of the polycrystalline structure, d.c. resistivity measurements are questionable. Optical measurements are especially suitable for an electrodeless evaluation of the resistivity; the IR optical band, located near 3 μm is discussed. More classical methods, including linear IR, dichroism and ESR measurements, are also presented and discussed."
"Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films were fabricated by use of an amphiphilic charge transfer complex, TMTTF-octadecylTCNQ (1). The film exhibited a bulk conductivity of 0.1 S cm−1 in the lateral direction without any doping or further treatments. High anisotropy of the conductivity was observed in the film: the conductivity in the normal direction was 10−14 S cm−1. The film was stable for at least three months in air at room temperature."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of an ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene (EDT-TTF) derivative containing hydroxyl groups, 4, 5-bis(11-hydroxyundecylthio)-4′, 5′-ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene were deposited without using stabilizer molecules. Doping of the film with iodine leads to oxidation of EDT-TTF moiety as evidenced by UV–vis and IR spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of layered arrangement of the EDT-TTF derivative molecules in the LB film. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicate that the electrochemical oxidation of the EDT-TTF derivative in its LB film is irreversible. Due to the insulating nature of the alkyl chains, only the first layer of the LB film was found to be redox-active. The electrical conductivity of the 25 layer LB film was found to increase by two orders of magnitude on doping with iodine. On equilibrating the doped film in air, the conductivity gradually reduced with time and finally reached the conductivity of undoped film. This reversibility could be because of the steric hindrance induced by the two long alkyl groups. The alkyl chains help in rendering the EDT-TTF molecule amiable to LB film formation but are found to reduce the electrical conductivity of the films and also cause instability of the doped state. The hydroxyl groups at the end of the alky chain impart amphiphilic nature to the molecules and help in stabilizing the film at the air–water interface."
"X-ray results for a novel conductor in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films cannot be explained with the classical head-to-head, tail-to-tail superimposed multilayer structure. Better agreement is obtained with a different model involving interdigitation of molecules. Multilayers of a charge transfer complex (N-docosyl pyridinium 7,7,8,8 tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)) are deposited onto calcium fluoride by the LB technique. At this stage the LB film is an insulator. Further in situ addition of iodine induces an insulator-conductor transition with a remarkable ordering of the lattice: 20 (00l) reflections have been recorded and the long spacing is 48.7 Å. The location of the iodine ions is obtained from the Patterson function. Fourier analysis (219 different combinations of phases) gives only one type of electron density profile with a plateau of constant electron density characteristicsof aliphatic chains. This electron density function can be explained by the interdigitation of adjacent molecules and gives a satisfactory picture of conduction by the stacking of TCNQ units in the polar region."
"Electrochemical polymerization in Langmuir-Blodgett multilayers of amphiphilic pyrrole derivatives resulted in anisotropic conducting thin films having alternate conducting and insulating layered structure."
"Abstract Conductive Langmuir–Blodgett films of tridecylmethylammonium–Au(dmit)2 complex are described. The 1:1 mixed films with icosanoic acid were converted into conductors by oxidation. The film exhibited the conductivity of ca. 25 S/cm, which showed the metallic temperature dependence around room temperature."

"An amphiphilic charge transfer complex with azobenzene introduced as a switching unit into the hydrophobic part was synthesized. The occurence of the reversible cis-trans photoisomerization of azobenzene in the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films depends on the state of aggregation of azobenzene. The conductivity in the LB film increases by ca. 20% on irradiation with UV light and reverts to the initial state on irradiation with visible light. The photoresponsive switching in the conductivity can be repeated more than 100 times without any noticeable fatigue."
"Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films made of a ternary compound N-docosylpyridinium-tetracyanoquinodimethane-iodine have been recently obtained by Ruaudel and co-workers (1985), after an in-situ oxidation of a precursor LB film. This paper describes a new well controlled method used to perform the iodine 'doping' in the precursor LB film. The chemical reactions involved in this process are followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Direct current and microwave conductivities of samples obtained in that way have both been measured in the range 300-120 K and are correctly fitted by the relation sigma = sigma 0 exp - Delta E/kT with two different activation energies: 0.15 eV and about 0.08 eV respectively. Thermoelectric power measurements have also been performed in the range 298-176 K and the Seebeck coefficient, the value of which is 26 mu V K-1 at room temperature, exhibits a linear-like behavior against 1/T with a slope dS/d(1/T) approximately=11 mV. All these measurements suggest a semiconducting behavior and are tentatively analysed in terms of an intrinsic semiconductor model. However, as an important discrepancy about the mobility value appears, the authors suggest a presumable interpretation in terms of hopping model between localised states. But they conclude that more precise information about the inplane molecular arrangement and the carrier density is needed to provide a more coherent model for the transport properties in these conducting films."
"Langmuir-Blodgett multilayer films consisting of 0 – 62 mol% purified α-quinquethiophene (QT) in cadmium stearate-stearic acid (ST) were deposited on glass substrates and characterized by a variety of methods. Exposure of these films to iodine vapor rendered them electrically conductive, the conductivities being strongly dependent on QT concentration and the number of layers deposited. The most conductive samples (≳ 35 mol% QT, ≳ 10 layers) had σ = 0.2 S cm−1. The concentration dependence of the conductivity can be broadly described by the two-site percolation models that take into account the specific chain arrangement and the finite conductivities of both the QT and ST aggregates in the films. Finally, the relevance of the QT-ST system to other conducting materials is discussed."
"Highly conducting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the tetramethyltetrathia-fulvalene- alkyltetracyanoquinodimethane (TMTTF-Cn TCNQ, where Cn represents CnH2n+1) system are reported. The electron affinities of the acceptors CnTCNQ (n=14, 18 or 22) in solution are almost the same and lie between those of TCNQ and dimethylTCNQ. These TCNQ derivatives form solid charge transfer complexes with TMTTF. The limiting areas of the complexes, normalized to the number of TCNQ derivatives at the air-water interface, are almost the same irrespective of the donor-to-acceptor ratio and of the length of the alkyl chain, indicating that the areas are governed by the TCNQ moiety. The monolayers of TMTTF-CnTCNQ (n=14 or 18) are transferred onto solid substrates as LB films. Polarized UV-visible absorption spectra indicate that the long axis of TCNQ is parallel to the film surface. These LB films exhibit lateral conductivities as high as 0.4 S cm-1 and 0.1 S cm-1 when n=14 and n=18 respectively."
"A novel dimethyl octadecyl sulphonium–tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) salt forms Langmuir–Blodgett films, which show a high degree of organization and which, after exposure to iodine vapour, give highly conducting films."
"A novel charge transfer complex of the ethylenedithiodioctadecylthiotetrathiafulvalene donor with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQF4) gives rise to conducting Langmuir–Blodgett films, after in situ iodine vapour treatment."
"We have investigated the molecular constitution and ordering of Langmuir–Blodgett films prepared by deposition of N-docosylpyridinium–TCNQ charge transfer salt onto CaF2 substrates and by their subsequent doping with iodine vapor to yield reasonably good (∼10−1 Ω−1 cm−1) conducting films. Optical and electron scanning microscopy of the precursor film show that it is made up of a mosaic of highly crystalline platelets lying flat on the substrate though with random orientation. Structural information at the molecular level is gained by measuring and analyzing the ESR spectra and their angular and temperature dependence as well as the UV-visible and infrared spectra and their linear dichroism. A triplet fine structure is observed in the ESR spectra of the precursor films with zero field splitting parameters ‖D‖=7.48×10−3 cm−1 and ‖E‖=1.2×10−3 cm−1 and singlet–triplet activation energy J=0.20 eV, markedly different from those of the N-docosylpyridinium–TCNQ powder salt. The UV-visible and infrared spectra show features typical of a system containing weakly interacting (TCNQ−)2 dimers similar to those found in a water solution. The dichroic behavior of the observed infrared active modes of the TCNQ− anion and of N-docosylpyridinium as well as of the vibronically induced absorptions of the interacting TCNQ system are analyzed both for the precursor and for the iodine doped film. According to such an analysis and to that of the angular dependence of the ESR line shapes, the polar sheets in the precursor film consist of slipped (ring-bond overlap) (TCNQ−)2 dimers with their molecular planes almost parallel to the plane of the supporting slide. The spectroscopic and linear dichroism data allow us to monitor the changes induced by the iodination process and to show that, besides the partial oxidation of TCNQ− anions to TCNQ0, there is a complete change in the orientation of the TCNQ units. In many respects, the UV-visible and infrared spectra of the conducting film resemble those of mixed valence, intermediate conductivity salts like, e.g., (TEA) (TCNQ)2. The TCNQ molecules stand edge on with their molecular planes roughly perpendicular to the plane of the slide and with their long axes close to being normal to it."
"Langmuir-Blodgett films of the 1 : 1 charge-transfer salt N-octadecylpyridinium-TCNQ have been deposited onto glass substrates. The layers exhibit significant bulk lateral conductivity without doping. The value obtained at room temperature is (2.0 ± 0.2) × 10−2 S cm−1; over the temperature range 100 – 300 K, the films show typical semiconductor behaviour with an activation energy of 0.13 ± 0.005 eV. Infrared and u.v.-visible transmission spectra of the films are characteristic of an organic conductor."
"Amphiphilic bis(tetrathiafulvalene) [bis(TTF)] macrocycles with four alkyl chains were fabricated as novel electrically active Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Two TTF units were linked via [24]crown-8, [21]crown-7, and [18]crown-6 macrocycles, forming charge-transfer (CT) salts with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) at the air-water interface and on solid substrates. The CT salt of the amphiphilic bis(TTF)-macrocycle having a [24]crown-8 ring system formed a uniform surface morphology on mica. Using single-crystal X-ray structural analysis, the layer structure between the hydrophobic chains and the one-dimensional pi-pi stack of the CT salt was confirmed. Our results show that the bis(TTF)-macrocycle was folded at the flexible [24]crown-8 moiety, forming intramolecular pi-pi dimer structures and one-dimensional intermolecular pi-pi stacks with F4-TCNQ dimers. The open-shell electronic structure of the LB films was determined by electronic spectra, electrical conductivity, and electron spin resonance analyses. Asymmetry was introduced into the bis(TTF)-macrocycle by changing the ring size from [24]crown-8 to [21]crown-7. The surface morphology of the CT salts with F4-TCNQ was established as two-dimensional round-shape domains on mica. Further reduction of the macrocyclic ring from [21]crown-7 to [18]crown-6 resulted in a CT salt of the bis(TTF)-macrocycle with F4-TCNQ with a leaf-shape domain morphology and a typical dimension of approximately 1 microm2 on mica. In general, decreasing the macrocyclic ring size from [24]crown-8 to [21]crown-7 or [18]crown-6 affected the inter- and intramolecular interactions and the surface morphologies of LB films."
"The elaboration of a purely organic ferromagnet requires a precise supramolecular organization, but up to now, it has proven impossible to control or even predict the way a given molecule will crystallize. We present here results showing that the Langmuir−Blodgett technique allows for such a control. Starting from a material with antiferromagnetic intermolecular interactions, we have been able to build monolayer Langmuir−Blodgett films with ferromagnetic interactions, as evidenced by electron spin resonance measurements."
"The ac complex magnetic susceptibilities, (χ′+iχ″), of conductive Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of ditetradecyldimethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (2C14–Au(dmit)2) have been measured in the temperature range 1.2–4.2 K. A diamagnetic transition of the real part, χ′, and a hump of the imaginary part, χ″, are observed at 3.9 K, indicating the Meissner state. The existence of the superconducting phase is indicated in the LB system below 3.9 K."
"Abstract Three types of photochemical switching phenomena in LB films were observed using amphiphilic molecules consisting of azobenzene, alkyl chain, and pyridinium(TCNQ)2. For two types the conductivity of the LB film changed reversibly with photoisomerization of azobenzene. The third type showed phenomena which are compared to the learning process."
"Langmuir-Blodgett films of a long-chain TCNQ derivative alternated with a long-chain TTF compound have been deposited onto glass substrates. These layers exhibit a bulk lateral conductivity of (5±1) × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Over the temperature range 100 – 300 K, typical semiconducting behaviour is observed, with a thermal activation energy of 0.26 ± 0.01 eV."

"Hexadecanoyltetrathiafulvalene (HDTTF) has been prepared by reaction of the lithium salt of TTF with hexadecanoyl chloride. Multilayers of HDTTF have been assembled on glass substrates; upon doping with iodine the films become highly insulating, but the conductivity increases with time following exposure, to reach a maximum value of 0.01 S cm−1 after a few hours. In contrast to this, films doped with bromine remain insulating."
"The fabrication of a thin film transistor based on a Langmuir-Blodgett film of an organo-metallic chargetransfer material, (N-octadecylpyridinium)-Ni(dmit)2 is reported. Saturation in the source-drain current is observed at large gate voltages. The charge carrier mobility is ̃ 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after the organic layer has been doped with iodine."
"An ESR investigation is performed on Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films consisting of a surface-active 1:2 complex of N-docosylpyridinium and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). A characteristic temperature dependence in the spin susceptibility and the linewidth is observed, which shows reasonable agreement with the random-exchange Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain (REHAC) model of Soos and Bondeson."
"An investigation into the molecular arrangements in Langmuir-Blodgett films of hexadecanoyltetrathiafulvalene is reported. Low-angle X-ray diffraction shows that, as deposited, the layers are organised in a simple head-to-head and tail-to-tail configuration (i.e. Y-type deposition). However, on doping with either iodine or bromine, the X-ray d-spacing is significantly reduced, implying that the molecules become interdigitated, tilted or both. The formation of a charge-transfer band for the iodine-doped multilayers is confirmed by IR spectroscopy. Experiments using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy reveal that the semiconducting properties of these samples are probably the result of the formation of a mixed-valence charge-transfer complex."
"Bis- and tris(tetrathiafulvalene) (TTF) amphiphiles 17-20 have been prepared by coupling together the mono-TTF derivatives 7, 9, 14 and 16. These novel bis- and tris-TTF amphiphiles showed improved stability in monolayer formation on a water surface, as compared to the mono-TTF-derivatives, and were deposited to give Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films."
"The title compound forms stable, high-quality Langmuir-Blodgett films which are highly conducting after iodine doping (σmax.1.0 ± 0.2 S cm–1); the films have been characterised, in the as-deposited and doped states, by variable temperature conductivity experiments, UVNIS, IR, and photoelectron spectroscopy, and by low-angle X-ray diffraction."
"Abstract Conductive LB films of dialkyldimethylammonium–Ni(dmit)2complexes are described. The precursor 1:1 complexes were transferred onto substrates and converted into conductors by the bromine oxidation. The bulk conductivities of the films were 10−3 to 10−1 S/cm, depending on the length of alkyl chain. The spectral changes during the oxidation was also examined."
"A new family of semiamphiphilic tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) ionic salts of nonconjugated cations, namely octadecyl-dimethylsulfonium, octadecyl-methyl-ethyl-sulfonium, and octadecyl-trimethylphosphonium labeled a, b, and c, respectively, has been synthetized. Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films are built up from these three compounds, which are mixed with octadecylurea in a molar ratio 1/1, in order to improve the stability of the film at the water surface. The structural properties of the transferred films are thoroughly investigated by linear dichroism in the IR and UV–visible ranges, together with ESR spectroscopy. In the films of the three compounds, the polar sheets contain (TCNQ− • )2 dimers, which are the largely prevalent species. The molecular planes of these dimers are found to be roughly parallel to the substrate. Moreover, a strong in-plane orientation of the dimers is found in films of compound c. This phenomenon is thought to be related to an overall flow orientation of rod-shaped crystallites in the floating film, during the high speed downstroke of the substrate across the film. Advantage is taken from the high and well-controlled thinness of LB films to make iodine vapor diffuse into the films and convert the precursor films into conducting ones. The iodination process leads for the three salts to a stable ternary conducting compound located in the polar planes of the LB assembly. Correlatively, it induces a strong molecular reorganization in the films: the TCNQ molecules stand on edge with their long molecular axis perpendicular to the substrate. In spite of this considerable rearrangement arising from iodination, we notice that the strong in-plane anisotropy observed in pristine films of c is retained in conducting films of the iodinated c compound. Beside these structural results, the IR spectra of conducting films are reminiscent of these of highly conducting, but not metallic-like, organic conductors. The conductivity of the films is estimated from their IR spectra and found to be 20–50 Ω−1 cm−1. However, dc conductivity measurements provide a value at least ten times lower than the one estimated from IR spectra. This behavior is likely related to the polycrystalline nature of the films whose macroscopic inhomogeneities are evidenced by scanning electron microscopy."
"We have demonstrated that the multiple photochemical switching device can be fabricated by successive deposition of two different photochemical switching Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films consisting of molecules with switching, transmission, and working units, each corresponding to azobenzene derivatives, alkyl chain, and conductive pyridinium (TCNQ)2 complex, respectively. The photoisomerization of switching units causes a change in conductivity of the LB films, which is associated with working units. When molecules with different switching units are used to assemble the device, its conductivity can be controlled by the irradiation with four types of control light."
"An ESR investigation has been performed on Langmuir-Blodgett film of a surface active 3:2 complex of TMTTF and 2-tetradecylTCNQ. In the temperature range of 100 K – 200 K anomalous behavior has been detected: the decrease in the spin susceptibility with decreasing temperature, the prominent maximum of the linewidth, and the maximum of g value. These strongly suggest an important role of Peierls instability in the system. Curie-like behavior observed below 100 K, however, reflects the higher concentration of disorder in comparison to the crystalline system."
"Compounds 1 and 2 form stable Langmuir–Blodgett films which after iodine doping are semiconducting (σrt= 10–3 S cm–1), demonstrating that the attachment of long alkyl chains is not a prerequisite for the formation of conducting LB films of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based charge-transfer complexes."
"A new semifluorinated tetrathiafulvalene (SFTTF) derivative was prepared and its behaviour at the air-water interface (π−A and ΔV−A isotherms) and in multilayer films was studied. The deposition (Y type) of such a pure SFTTF monolayer (i.e. without fatty acid) onto solid substrates was successful with a good transfer ratio. X-ray experiments and IR dichroism suggests a tilt angle (ca.35°) of the semifluorinated chains with respect to the normal of the substrate. Under an atmosphere saturated with iodine vapours, the Langmuir-Blodgett films exhibit a brown colour with a broad charge transfer band around 8500 cm−1 and a low d.c. conductivity, suggesting the formation of totally ionized TTF-type dimers. After iodination and under air exposure, iodine is rapidly lost by the films and a new charge transfer band around 3400 cm−1 appears, indicating the formation of partially ionized dimers. These changes are analysed through a reversible iodination-deiodination cycle."
"A new strategy for building conducting LB films is presented. The conducting behaviour is obtained by mixing in the same layer amphiphilic and semi-amphiphilic TCNQ derivatives. The optimum conductivity (6.9*10-3 S cm-1) is obtained for hybrid stacks of TCNQ in which the average electronic charge is -0.33."
"We report the magnetotransport properties up to 7 T in the organic highly conducting Langmuir-Blodgett(LB) films formed by a molecular association of the electroactive donor molecule bis(ethylendioxy)tetrathiafulvalene (BEDO-TTF) and stearic acid CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{16}$COOH. We show the logarithmic decrease of dc conductivity and the negative transverse magnetoresistance at low temperature. They are interpreted in the weak localization of two-dimensional (2D) electronic system based on the homogeneous conducting layer with the molecular size thickness of BEDO-TTF. The electronic length with phase memory is given at the mesoscopic scale, which provides for the first time evidence of the 2D coherent charge transport in the conducting LB films."
"Conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of alkylammonium-metal(dmit)2 (where H2dmit ≡ 4,5-dimercapto-1,3-dithiol-2-thione) system are described. Mono-alkyl-substituted ammonium to tetra-alkyl-substituted ammonium were used as the counter-cation and nickel, gold, palladium and platinum were used as the central metal cation. These complexes were transferred onto solid substrates with or without icosanoic acid as a matrix. The LB films were oxidized either by bromine oxidation or electrochemical oxidation. The majority of the LB films showed a conductivity of the order of 0.1–1 S cm−1. The LB film of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit)2, however, showed a conductivity of 30 S cm−1 after electrochemical oxidation. Moreover, this film showed metallic behaviour down to around 200 K with a weak temperature dependence. The IR spectrum of the oxidized film was consistent with the metallic behaviour of the film."
"In order to obtain an ultrathin conductor as a two-dimensional (2D) layered arrangement of organic molecules, we have built up Langmuir—Blodgett (LB) films from N-docosylpyridinium+-TCNQ charge transfer salt. The morphology of these films is closey investigated by means of three interrelated methods. (a) High-resolution optical microscopy, performed with light reflected under crossed polarizers from the air-water interface, enables us to observe the film directly during the compression, before its transfer onto a solid substrate. (b) Optical microscopy, using the Nomarsky interference contract method, allow us to observe the film which has been transferred onto a solid substrate even at low surface pressures through a special method, the so-called “touching” method. (c) Transmission electron microscopy together with electron diffraction provides information about the crystallinity of the transferred films. We observe a three-dimensional (3D) crystallization, which takes place in the film compressed at the air-water interface. This is shown by the birefringent behavior of some parts of the film, and by the different charges acquired by crystalline and amorphous areas in SEM, and also by electron diffraction patterns. This crystallization can arise even at surface pressures as low as 10 mN/m, if the time spent by the film at the air-water interface is long enough. It causes a plateau in the surface-pressure-area per molecule isotherm. The resulting 3D flat crystals exhibit a trapezoidal shape with well-defined angles and very sharp edges. Their surface appears rather rough, which is typical for amphiphilic molecules with loosely packed chains. From the thickness measurements performed on filmes transferred at a surface pressure of about 15 mN/m, after platinum shadowing, the crystals appear to be made of three super-imposed monolayers. The crystallization phenomenon is tentatively interpreted on the basis of an instability arising from the molecular arrangement in the film compressed at the air-water interface. The investigation of this system provides information about the molecular geometries required to build up genuine two-dimensional monomolecular layers, which could lead to ultrathin 2D LB conducting films."

"The electrical properties of novel Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films based on tetrathiotetracenes (TTT), dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (TA) and carotenoids were studied. Upon doping with iodine vapour the conductivity of the LB films could be increased by several orders of magnitude. The highest conductivity was found for a doped TTT derivative (10−2 Scm−1). LB films of TTT derivatives which had also been electrochemically oxidized and reduced showed a reversible electrochromism with colour changes between blue in the neutral and red in the oxidized state. While LB films of the TTT and TA derivatives were conducting only in the direction parallel to the layer plane, the carotenoid were also conducting in the normal direction. The optical and structural properties of the undoped and doped LB films were also investigated."

"Metallic Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were fabricated by mixing bis-ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene, or BEDO-TTF and behenic acid. The maximum conductivity in as-deposited LB films reached 40 S/cm at room temperature. Temperature dependence of the dc conductivity shows metallic behavior down to 14 K. Percolation does not dominate conduction in these LB films. A possible layered model of the LB films is proposed from the results of surface pressure-area isotherm, infrared absorption, and x-ray diffraction experiments."
"Electroactive cyclodextrins persubstituted with pendant tetrathiafulvalene moieties were synthesized and electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry. They show a very good ability to be transferred as Langmuir–Blodgett films, independently of the hydrophobic character of the redox active part."
"Langmuir-Blodgett films of a long chain tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) donor derivative (BEDT-TTFC18) were deposited onto different substrates for investigating several physical properties before and after doping by a few oxidizing agents. In the presence of ICl vapour, two different phases, insulating and semi-conducting, were obtained, as shown by electron spin resonance, IR and Raman spectroscopies. From these preliminary results, it seems that the doping chemical process is different from the well known charge transfer occurring in organic conductors."
"Conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of dialkyldimethylammonium-metal(dmit)2 complexes are described. The precursor 1:1 complexes of Ni and Au were transferred onto substrates using icosanoic acid as a matrix. The conductive LB films were obtained by the bromine oxidation. The bulk conductivities in the lateral direction were 10−3 to 10−1 S/cm, depending on the length of alkyl chain. The conductivity of the Ni complex LB film was found to be Arrhenius-type with an activation energy of 0.065 eV, whose origin is not clear at present. The spectral changes during the oxidation of the LB films of Ni complex indicated that the species similar to those obtained from the bromine oxidation of (Bu4N) [Ni(dmit)2] were predominant in the oxidized LB film."
"Electronic transport measurements are reported for Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit) 2 for 300-4 K. The conductivity after electrochemical oxidation is 30-50 S/cm at room temperature, increases with decreasing temperature, and begins decrease at about 200 K. The conductivity at lower temperatures is explained by two-dimensional variable range hopping (2D VRH). The thermoelectric power ( S ) is positive and well fitted by a linear combination of the temperature dependence of 2D VRH ( S v \propt T 1/3 ) and that of metal ( S m \propt T ). These results can be explained by a model in which highly conductive metallic regions are separated by thin weakly conductive regions. The UV/visible absorption spectra and the X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that a large structural change occurs accompanied by electrochemical oxidation."
"We report recent work developed in Saclay. BEDT derivatives possessing two aliphatic chains both grafted at the same end of the electroactive nucleus have been used. Hence in the resulting films, the conjugated systems stand on edge with their long axis perpendicular to the support. After a controlled oxidation by iodine vapour, films are obtained as conducting sheets, the DC conductivity of which is close to 0.2 S cm−1 at room temperature. Such a structure is especially designed to mimic the sheet-like molecular array of classical (BEDT)2I3 highly conducting or even superconducting bulk crystals. In addition, the stoichoimetries are found to be basically the same. The DC conductivity abruptly decreases as the number of superimposed monolayers decreases and a bilayer thick film is found to be an insulator. Such a behaviour is understood in terms of superimposed conducting domains separated by more or less insulating boundaries. Basically different properties are currently obtained by the use of homodoped TCNQ containing films. The homodoping strategy consists of mixing in the same monolayer neutral amphiphilic octadecyl TCNQ (OD-TCNQ) together with the anion radical semi-amphiphilic TCNQ salts, for example octadecylsulfonium+ TCNQ−. Hybrid stacks are obtained in that way. The everage electronic charge of TCNQ (and hence the conductivity) can be accurately adjusted by properly choosing the molecular ratio of the individual components."
"An electron spin resonance (ESR) investigation is performed on Langmuir-Blodgett films consisting of a surface-active 1:2 complex of N-docosylpyridinium and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), whose temperature-dependent spin susceptibility has been so far found to be consistent with the random-exchange Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain (REHAC) model of Soos and Bondeson. An out-of-plane anisotropy in the ESR spectra shows that the long axes of TCNQ molecules are preferentially oriented along the plane normal to the sample, where the negligible in- plane anisotropy indicates the random distribution of the short and the pπ orbital axes in the film plane. A heat treatment applied to the samples results in an increase in the concentration of disorder, showing the possibility of controlling it in the present REHAC system."

"The complex magnetic susceptibility was measured for the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of ditetradecyldimethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (2C14-Au(dmit)2) using an ac inductive method. A diamagnetic transition of the real part (χ′) was observed at around 4 K under a weak ac field of 0.1 mT (80 Hz) and it was shifted toward the lower side for about 0.6 K with superposing a dc field of 60 mT. These results suggest existence of a superconducting phase in the 2C14-Au(dmit)2 LB system."
"We have obtained very stable Langmuir films from a (1:1) mixture of a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative (ethylenedithiodioctadecylthio TTF) with ω-tricosenoic acid, compressed on a pure water subphase at surface pressures up to about 35 mN/m. These films can be transferred by the classical Langmuir-Blodgett method with a constant transfer efficiency close to unity, and films more than 100 layers thick can be built up in this way. After exposure to iodine vapor and subsequent moderate heating at about 40°C, these films become conducting, and their in-plane direct current conductivity reaches a value of about 2 × 10−1Ω−1 · cm−1 at room temperature. A preliminary interpretation of this behavior is proposed and strong arguments are brought out in favor of an electronic conduction mechanism arising from a mixed valence state in the TTF derivative array."
"A charge-transfer complex between an amphiphilic bis(tetrathiafulvalene) (bis-TTF) annulated macrocycle (1) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), (12+)(F4-TCNQ-)2, which can form molecular-assembly nanowires by application of the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) method, was hybridized with gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 13 nm. LB films of (12+)(F4-TCNQ)2 were transferred onto a substrate surface from a subphase containing gold nanoparticles at concentrations ranging from 10-6 to 10-4 M, based on the number of gold atoms in the subphase (cAu). One-dimensional nanowires and zero-dimensional gold nanoparticles were found to coexist in films transferred onto mica by a single withdrawal from a subphase with cAu less than 1 × 10-5 M, whereas films transferred from a subphase with cAu greater than 1 × 10-4 M formed network structures of gold nanoparticles, which was confirmed by AFM measurements as well as electronic spectroscopy. The room-temperature electrical conductivities of the latter LB films (cAu > 1 × 10-4 M) were 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the former (cAu< 1 × 10-5 M). The films, which contained nanoparticle network structures, showed two types of conducting behavior depending on the temperature range (above and below ∼150 K). At higher temperatures, conduction was dominated by (12+)(F4-TCNQ-)2, which is an intrinsic semiconductor, whereas collective tunneling charge transport in the gold nanoparticle network structure was observed at lower temperatures. In the prepared films, the gold nanoparticles were randomly connected to each other, and a random single electron tunneling array yielded a finite threshold voltage (Vth) at lower temperatures due to Coulomb blockade behavior and three-dimensional correlation of the conducting paths."
"Electrically conductive thin films of TTFxTCNQ1−x alloys (x:molar composition), both lacking long chain alkyls, have found to be able to form onto hydrophobic substrates using the horizontal lifting Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Despite long chain alkyls lack, film thickness of 70 A/stamp is achieved. Electrical conductivities of the films as a function of x show two maxima at non-stoichiometric compositions: σRT=5.5 Scm−1 at x=0.6 at 1.5 Scm−1 at x=0.4. These values are one order higher than the previously reported values for conductive Langmuir-Blodgett films."
"Electron-spin-resonance measurements were performed on the newly developed conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films consisting of a charge-transfer complex of bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene (BO) and decyltetracyanoquinodimethane. The temperature-dependent spin susceptibility and linewidth clearly indicate that the major region of the films has a metallic nature. The density of states has been estimated as 3.5 states/eV per BO molecule, assuming no electron correlation. No metal-insulator transition has been detected at least down to 50 K, while an anomaly seen in the linewidth around 140 K suggests a certain kind of structural transition."
"The role of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in the characterization of Langmuir—Blodgett (LB) films is discussed. Early examples of the application of ESR spectroscopy in LB films are the studies of the structural and magnetic properties of fatty acid LB films containing metallic ions such as Cu2+ and Mn2+ and those of photoinduced electron-transfer processes in films containing donor and acceptor monolayers. In recent years, many varieties of molecules have been incorporated into LB films to develop films having new functions related to optical, electrical and other properties. LB films have also been employed as model systems for the study of the basic properties of molecular aggregates. As a result, there are increasing numbers of cases where the ESR technique has played a major role in elucidating the microscopic properties of these new LB films. Three cases are discussed here as illustrative examples. The first topic is the analysis of the in-plane anisotropy of the ESR spectra of the stable radical in merocyanine dye LB films, from which a flow orientation of the dye aggregates has been suggested as the origin of the in-plane anisotropy often observed in LB films. The hyperfine coupling due to a nitrogen in the dye molecule has been identified. The second case introduces the studies of conducting LB films composed of charge-transfer complexes. ESR can provide direct evidence for the formation of the conducting columnar structures of the constituent molecules through the temperature-dependent spin susceptibilities, which show the characteristics of low-dimensional metals or magnetic systems associated with structural disorder. In some systems, the molecular orientation and the magnetic interactions of quasi-one-dimensional spin chains have been deduced from the analysis of the spectral line shapes. The third case refers to LB films containing paramagnetic metallic ions, which still represent an important class of materials. The metallic ions act as well-localized probes in revealing the local orientation of molecules, the aggregation structure of molecules (such as dimer formation) and so on. Most of the research so far has been based on the standard continuous-wave ESR technique. A few works have been reported using the more advanced techniques of ESR, such as ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance) and ESE (electron spin echo). These techniques, as well as others, are expected to extend the area of ESR application in the studies of LB films."
"Ethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene (EDT–TTF) derivatives1–4 functionalised with a single aromatic ring have been synthesised and their Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films have been assembled utilising only 25% molar ratio of fatty acid. For compounds 1, 3 and 4, predominantly Y-type deposition onto solid supports was observed with a transfer ratio close to unity. After doping with iodine vapour, the maximum in-plane conductivity values obtained were σ rt =10 -3 S cm -1 for 1 and 3, and 10 -5 S cm -1 for 4. LB deposition of 2 was not uniform and the conductivity value after doping was low. UV–VIS spectra of the LB films reveal the appearance of a charge-transfer (CT) band at λ max =ca. 900 nm for 1 and 4 after iodine doping. A solution of compound 3 exhibited a weak absorption band at ca. 665 nm which is assigned to an intramolecular CT band; the intensity of this band increases on exposure of the solution to light. This band is not observed in LB films of 3, neither as-deposited nor after doping. Molecular orbital calculations indicate that in the minimum energy conformation of 3, the pyridinium moiety is practically orthogonal to the TTF unit and this conformation may be obtained in solution, enabling charge-transfer to occur. A more linear conformation of 3 in the LB films may prevent intramolecular charge-transfer from occurring. Monolayers of 1, 3 and 4 were characterised by cyclic voltammetry which revealed two redox steps consistent with the formation of the EDT–TTF cation radical and dication, respectively."
"Bis- and tris-tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives have been prepared by coupling together TTF monoacids and diacids with diaminopropane spacers. These new materials were successfully deposited to give Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films, but the films generally showed low conductivity, except for one non-amphiphilic sample that had been doped with iodine (σrt= 6 × 10–3 S cm–1). This demonstrates that non-amphiphilic TTF derivatives can be used to prepare conducting LB films without the addition of stabilising materials such as fatty acids."
"Multilayer structures of the charge transfer complex (N-octadecylpyridinium)-Ni(dmit)2 have been deposited by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique onto substrates of gold-coated glass and silicon with a thermally grown overlayer of silicon dioxide. Capacitance measurements have revealed values of relative permittivity of 3.2 and 6.3 for the dmit layers in the as-deposited state and after iodine doping respectively. Thin film transistor structures have been built up incorporating the dmit complex as the semiconducting layer. Modulation and saturation of a current flowing between source and drain by a voltage applied to the gate has been observed. The mobilities of the charge carriers in the dmit layers have been calculated as 2.4×10−5 cm2 V−1 in the as-deposited state and 1.8×10−1 cm V−1 s−1 after doping with iodine."
"The LB films of the charge transfer complexes of oxygen-containing BEDT-TTF type donor bisethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene (BO) and long-chain derivatives of tetracyanoquinodimethane (CnTCNQ) are prepared with and without matrix molecules. The measurements of π-A isotherm for the complex-icosanoic acid mixed system indicated the formation of mixed monolayers at the air-water interface. This was confirmed by the AFM measurements showing a granular structure of the film with the grain size of 100 nm in diameter and 3–4 nm in height. These grains are probably attributable to the BO complex. The conductivity of the LB films were strongly affected by the film-deposition method, the spreading solvent and the matrix. The mixed LB films of BO-C10TCNQ and BO-C14TCNQ with icosanoic acid under suitable conditions showed conductivities as high as 10 and 3 S/cm, respectively. The former LB film showed a metallic temperature dependence of conductivity down to 250 K. The conduction mechanism is discussed in terms of the film granuality."

"The behaviour of the metal complex anion salts (R+)2[Ni(dmit)2]2−, (R+)2[Ni(mnt)2]2− and R+[Ni(dmit)2]− where R+ = (CH3)2(C12H25)2N+ at the air-water interface has been investigated. Reproducible isotherms are obtained only by leaving the salts on the water surface for over an hour. This time is reduced at higher subphase temperatures. From surface pressure isotherms it is concluded that the limiting area at collapse is governed mainly by the dodecyl chains of the cation, with some contribution from vertically stacked anions. Surface potential measurements suggest that the ionic charges of the salt are coplanar. LB deposited films of the pure salts all show a large increase in conductivity when exposed to bromine vapour."
"We describe the properties of pristine and iodine-doped Langmuir-Blodgett films built up from a new semi-amphiphilic tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) salt, namely trimethyloctadecylphosphonium TCNQ. The films are transferred from a water subphase to a solid substrate. After exposure to diluted iodine vapour, the films become conducting. This behaviour is checked by the IR absorption spectrum. The conductivity estimated from the energy of the maximum of the charge transfer absorption band is about 20–50 Ω-1 cm-1."
"In an effort to prepare high-spin-ordered layers, several conjugated molecules bearing one nitronyl nitroxide radical (NN) or two imino nitroxide magnetically coupled radicals (IN) have been synthesized. The monoradical and the biradical molecules proved to be amphiphilic enough to form Langmuir films on a water surface. For the two monoradicals, the molecular area extrapolated at zero-surface pressure in the final part of the isotherms is nearly the same (A0 ∼ 0.55 nm2 molecule-1) and close to what may be expected for such molecular shapes. For the longest rigid-rod biradical, bis imino nitroxide pentamer, 5p(bisIN), the pressure−area isotherm shows a low compressibility and Brewster angle microscopy has revealed that the film is solidlike, the molecules having a tendency to aggregate, forming plates on the water surface. The bis imino nitroxide trimer, 3p(bisIN), has a larger final molecular area A0 ∼ 0.80 nm2 molecule-1, the molecules being, by then, oriented perpendicular to the surface as deduced from grazing incidence X-ray analysis (GIXA) and surface potential measurements. After deposition of monolayers on various hydrophilic substrates by the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) technique, the biradical 3p(bisIN) happens to be the most interesting molecule since good transfer ratios (TR) are easily obtained and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements indicate paramagnetic properties. In addition, atomic-force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the films shows defects in the form of elevated zones. The AFM reveals that these zones are partially made of molecules piling up, their heights being multiples of single-molecule lengths. These elevated domains occur in different shapes, either randomly distributed circular zones or aligned, coalesced domains lying along preferred directions. Y-type multilayers up to nine layers were also transferred on hydrophilic glass, with a somewhat poorer TR."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the complex bis-(N-octadecylpyridinium)–[Ni(dmit)2]1 are highly conducting, σmax= 0.8 S cm–1 after iodine doping, and have been characterised, in the as-deposited and doped states, by IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; LB films of complex 1 alternated with O-hexadecylthiocarboxytetrathiafulvalene 2 are conducting, σmax= 0.1 S cm–1 after iodine doping."
"The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method has been proved to be useful in attaining high conductivity by arranging the amphiphilic 1:2 charge transfer complex, N-docosylpyridinium-(TCNQ)2 without doping or further treatments. The lateral conductivities of the monolayer at air-glycerin interface and the LB film are higher than that of the compaction sample by several orders. The activation energy of DC conductivity is obtained as 0.3 eV. The LB films of the 1:2 complex are stable for at least two months in air at room temperature. The incorporation of eicosanoic acid, an insulator, as much as 25% into these films does not affect the conductivity significantly."
"LB films have been fabricated by transferring poly(o-anisidine) (POA) monolayers from a pure water surface onto glass substrates using the conventional dipping method. The chemically synthesized poly(o-anisidine) consists of two fractions, one containing mainly octamers and another of high molecular weight (around 28000 g/mol). The low weight fraction forms condensed Langmuir monolayers which are anchored to the water surface through one single group, probably the metoxy-aniline, yielding an area per molecule of ca. 20 Å2. The molecular configuration in the high-weight fraction monolayers appears to be such that one in each four or five segments of the polymer chain makes contact with the water. UV-visible spectra were obtained for the HW fraction LB films which were identical to those of POA in solution, changing from dark blue to green when the film is exposed to HCl vapour. Preliminary conductivity measurements were carried out on these LB films showing that the conductivity increases by three orders of magnitude upon exposure to HCl vapour."
"The properties of Langmuir films are generally dependent on the pH of the subphase. In a previous work, for instance, we observed that Langmuir films from poly(o-ethoxyaniline) (POEA) suitable for Langmuir-Blodgett deposition were only obtained if spread on an acidic subphase. Because POEA is highly soluble in both undoped and doped states, we have now extended these studies to systematically investigate the effect of doping on the fabrication of Langmuir and LB films. The pressure-area isotherms of the Langmuir films display less hysteresis and higher collapse pressures, when the polymer is doped in solution prior to spreading of the monolayer on an acidic subphase. This procedure leads to stable films that can be readily deposited in the form of LB films."
"Conducting films of high quality can be deposited from the surface of pure water using mixtures of neutral surfacant donor and acceptor molecules. Results of an investigation of multilayers prepared from different combinations of donor and acceptor molecules are presented. The relationships between the composition of the mixture, conditions of the film preparation, structure of the multilayers obtained on the one hand and the electrical properties of the films on the other hand are ascertained. Temperature dependences of conductivity are measured. The changes in the structure and morphology under temperature variations are recorded by means of electron diffraction and electron microscopy. Field effects were also studied."
"The conductivity of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films was examined in terms of a granular structure. The conductivity of bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene-decyltetracyanoquinodimethane (BO-C10TCNQ) LB film was well fitted by the formula, σ = AT−αexp(-Ea/kT), where the behavior is determined by the semiconducting domain boundaries in the granular-structured film. The metallic nature of the domains was revealed by thermoelectric power measurements: the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power was almost linear with T. The temperature dependence of the conductivity in tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (3C10-Au) LB film is well explained by a linear combination of Sheng's model and common metal, R = C1exp[T1(T+T0)] + C2T. The conduction was governed by the fluctuation-induced tunneling between metallic domains."
"A new class of derivatized conducting polypyrrole Langrnuir-Blodgett films have been prepared with electroactive groups covalently attached to alkyl-pyrroles. Specifically, we have studied copolymers formed by polymerizing mixed 3-alkyl pyrrole and ferrocene-3-alkyl pyrrole (Fc-Py) at the air-water interface, with the subphase containing FeCl3. When the Fc-Py containing LB film is deposited on an electrode surface, the resulting derivatized electrode can be used for reoxidizing reduced flavin enzymes such as glucose oxidase."
"A method for forming conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films of charge-transfer salts based on the interaction between surfactant donor molecules spread at the air/water interface and inorganic compounds dissolved in water is proposed. Films of hexadecylbis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene with small additions of surfactant acceptor molecules were deposited from water subphases containing FeCl3 or CuSo4. High quality films with conductivity of 2 Ω−1 cm−1 were deposited at pH of 3.8 when Fe3+ ions at a concentration of 10−4 M were used. In order to study the interaction of donor molecules with the compounds dissolved in water, electron probe analysis of the films was carried out. Variants of charge-transfer salt formation are discussed."
"We describe the behaviour of a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of a mixed-valence charge-transfer salt regarding the detection of phosphine. This salt is the N-octadecyl pyridinium, tetracyanoquinodimethane (NOPy+, TCNQ−1.4, TCNQ°. Its structure and electrical properties have recently been studied. After deposition, the film shows a conductivity of 0.8 × 10−3 ohm−1 cm−1. This conductivity is enhanced by doping with iodine to obtain a conductivity of 0.05 ohm−1 cm−1. This high conductivity value allows us to design a sensor based on a simple resistance measurement. On exposure to phosphine diluted in nitrogen, the resistivity of the film increases. Different parameters have been investigated: concentration of phosphine, nitrogen flow and temperature. The detection is limited by diffusion, but the signal after one minute is significant. Increasing the temperature results in a better response, which is optimal for a nitrogen flow of 15 l h−1 (i.e., 0.3 m s−1 above the detector). The study demonstrates the ability of (NOPy+ TCNQ−)1.4, TCNQ° to detect phosphine with a detection limit below 1 ppm."
"Poly(o-alkoxyaniline) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were deposited onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass electrodes using the vertical dipping method. The electrochemical response of multilayer LB films was investigated by cyclic voltammetry which showed, in an acidic aqueous solution, well defined redox processes similar to those observed in films prepared by conventional methods. The film color changed with the applied potential and was related to redox and protonation-deprotonation reactions which lead to changes in the doping level and oxidation state of the poly(o-alkoxyaniline) films."
"Binary mixtures of charge transfer complexes as well as mixtures of neutral surfactant donor and acceptor molecules are used for deposition of conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films. The formation of a new charge transfer complex between surfactant components occurs at the gas-water interface during monolayer formation or in the process of film deposition. Conducting films of high homogeneity and good morphology can be deposited in this manner. An Electron diffraction and electron microscopy study of the films was carried out. The probable molecular packing patterns for the monolayers of donors and acceptors are determined. The structure models of the two-component conducting films studied are proposed on the basis of electron diffraction data and the calculated packing patterns for one-component monolayers."
"A new method is proposed for preparing electrically conducting fine lines in Langmuir-Blodgett films: during transference of arachidic acid L film containing pyrrole monomers to an indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate, a voltage was applied between the ITO and the platinum counterelectrode dipped in the water subphase. From microscopic observations and conductivity measurements, it was confirmed that conducting filaments of polypyrrole were formed by this new method along the contact line between the substrate and the water surface by electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole monomers in an arachidic L film."
"Three new tetra-substituted derivatives of the good one-electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF, 1), namely, an asymmetrical diacid with two hexadecylthio groups (TTF(SC16)2(SCH2CO2H)2, 3), an asymmetrical diester with two hexadecylthio groups (TTF(SC16)2(SCH2CO2Me)2, 4) and a symmetrical derivative with four hexadecylthio groups (TTF(SC16)4, 11), have been prepared. These yield stable ‘Pockels-Langmuir’ (PL) monolayers at the air/water interface; some transfer well to a solid support as Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, when the strong electron acceptor 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQF4) is also added to the air/water interface. However, TCNQF4 does not transfer onto the LB films. Iodine doping of LB multilayers of 4 yields moderate in-plane conductivity."
"Conductive Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films based on dialkyldimethylammonium–Au(dmit)2 complex are described. The surface pressure (π) vs. area per molecule (A) isotherm suggests that the pure complex gives a film of good quality at the air/water interface without using matrices. The UV-visible absorption spectra indicate the reproducible film deposition for up to 20 layers onto substrates. To render the as-deposited films conductive, an electrochemical oxidation is performed. The resultant in-plane conductivities are 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the corresponding systems when arachidic acid is used as the matrix with 1:1 molar ratio."
"The chemical synthesis of a new soluble polyaniline derivative, poly(o-phenetidine), was carried out with monomer excess and the polymer obtained was characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. The poly(o-phenetidine) has chemical and structural properties which are consistent with a pure polymer in the emeraldine oxidation state. Poly(o-phenetidine) Langmuir monolayers were spread from chloroform or dichloromethane solutions on an aqueous solution whose pH was varied from 6 to 2. Because kinetic effects on monolayer compression are extremely important for monolayers from preformed polymers, the influence of the various experimental parameters on the monolayer characteristics was investigated. It is shown that high transfer ratios are obtained in the LB deposition process when Langmuir monolayers are fabricated from very dilute dichloromethane solutions, spread on a low pH subphase, and compressed at a barrier speed of 30 mm min−1. The monolayer is then transferred onto a solid substrate by vertical dipping. UV—visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry of the deposited LB films reveal essentially the same behavior as cast poly(o-phenetidine) films."
"The electrochemical behaviour of monolayer and multilayer films of hexadecanoyltetrathiafulvalene, deposited on conductive substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, has been studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and visible/infrared spectroscopy. Monolayer films show stable reversible oxidation to the cation-radical state. However, in thicker structures, the electrochemical response is strongly distorted because of the hindered diffusion of ions."
"The resistivity of the LB film of ditetradecyldimethylammonium-Au(dmit) 2 (2C 14 -Au(dmit) 2 ) was measured in the temperature range 2-300 K. A resistivity drop or an appreciable change of the temperature derivative is seen at 3.9 K, suggesting the existence of superconducting phase below that temperature."
"The structure of the conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film consisting of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (3C10-Au) and arachidic acid is studied by the X-ray diffraction method and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochemically ClO−4-doped film is found to possess four phases with different interlayer spacings by the X-ray diffraction method. The intralayer molecular arrangement is found for the 3C10-Au matrix by AFM."

"Electromodified Langmuir-Blodgett films of a phenolate-rich [Co(III)(L(N2O3))H2O] metallosurfactant support water oxidation at an overpotential of 0.5 V. Gradual enhancement of catalytic activity is observed between 1 and 9 deposited layers. Upon application of a potential bias the molecular species rearranges into a catalytic layer that yields estimated turnover numbers of 54 000 ± 1500 h(-1)."
"The title compound was prepared by reducing octadecanoyl-TTF with lithium aluminium hydride and subsequent complexation with TCNQ. Langmuir-Blodgett films of the complex could be built-up on glass or calcium fluoride substrates. These multilayer films have been characterised by UV-visible and infrared spectral measurements. Conductivity values at room temperature of around 10-3 S cm-1 were obtained, with an activation energy of 0.27 eV over the temperature range 80-320 K."
"Mixed organic/inorganic Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films have been prepared in which the polar network is a manganese phosphonate continuous lattice and the organic network contains a substituted tetrathiafulvalene amphiphile. The bis(phosphonic acid) amphiphile, 2,3-bis[(4'-phosphonobutyl)thio]-6,7-bis(tetradecylthio)tetrathiafulvalene, 1, has been synthesized and deposited from an aqueous Mn2+ subphase to form Y-type LB films with stoichiometry Mn2(1)(H2O)2. Since the amphiphile is a bis(phosphonate), the inorganic network forms the Mn(O3PR)H2O structure known in other manganese phosphonate LB films and layered solids. The film becomes magnetic near 11.5 K when the manganese phosphonate network orders as a canted antiferromagnet. Attempts to subsequently oxidize the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) network did not result in stable phases. Structural characterization was aided by the synthesis of a solid-state manganese bis(phosphonate) model compound, Mn2(2)(H2O)2, where 2 is the ligand 2,3-bis[(2'-phosphonoethyl)thio]-6,7-bis(methylthio)tetrathiafulvalene."
"Multilayer structures of a (N-octadecylpyridinium)2-Ni(dmit)2 charge-transfer complex (H2dmit = 4,5-dimercapto-1,3-dithiole-2-thione) have been deposited onto glass substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Electrical measurements have been made over the temperature range 100–300 K in the as-deposited state and after chemical doping with iodine. Room temperature in-plane conductivities were 6 × 10−6 S cm−1 and 0.2−0.8 S cm−1 for films as-deposited and after iodine doping, respectively. As-doposited, a linear current versus voltage characteristic was observed and a plot of log (current) versus reciprocal temperature was found to consist of more than one straight line section. Activation energies of 0.59 eV, 0.32 eV and 0.14 eV were measured over different parts of the temperature range studied. After doping with iodine, a current versus voltage plot with a “super-Ohmic” section was noted. In this case, two different activation energies were found; 0.17 ± 0.2 eV at low bias and 0.09 eV for higher applied voltages. A study of the stability of conductivity with time has also been undertaken; films were found to be stable for a period of at least 1 month."
"Thermoelectric power in highly conductive Langmuir-Blodgett films of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (σRT 30−50 Scm) was examined. The metallic nature of this material is suggested from the results of the thermoelectric power. The resistivity increased with aging, however the thermoelectric power was invariant. These results suggest that the metallic nature of the film is preserved after aging. The newly developed conductive LB films of didecyldimethylammonium-Pd(dmit)2 showed a high conductivity of 5.1 Scm at room temperature. From the temperature dependence of the conductivity, semiconductor-like transport was suggested."

"Conductive Langmuir-Blodgett films of ditetradecyldimethylammonium-Au(dmit) 2 (dmit=1,3 dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate) have been fabricated without the use of matrix molecules. The in-plane dc conductivity was as high as 40 S/cm after electrochemical oxidation at room temperature. A metallic conductivity with a negative temperature derivative was observed in the temperature range of 250–300 K. At lower temperatures, the temperature dependence of the conductivity was of Arrhenius' type with an activation energy of 2.5 meV."
"Electrically active Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films based on charge-transfer (CT) complexes between an amphiphilic monopyrrolo-tetrathiafulvalene (MP-TTF) electron donor and different derivatives of the electron acceptor 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TCNQ), namely, 2,5-difluoro-TCNQ, fluoro-TCNQ, TCNQ, decyl-TCNQ, 2,5-dimethyl-TCNQ, and 2-methoxy-5-ethoxy-TCNQ, have been fabricated and investigated systematically. The electronic ground state of the CT complex, (MP-TTF+δ)(TCNQs-δ), in the LB films varied from ionic (δ = 1) to neutral (δ ∼ 0) depending on the electron affinity of the TCNQ derivative used. CT excitation energies of the LB films were correlated against the difference between the redox potentials of the MP-TTF and TCNQ derivatives, exhibiting agreement with a neutral−ionic (N−I) phase diagram proposed for mixed-stack CT complexes. Of the six kinds of LB films, the (MP-TTF+0.3)(decyl-TCNQ-0.3) and (MP-TTF+0.6)(TCNQ-0.6) complexes were located closest to the N−I phase boundary. In all of the LB films, the CT transition moment was found to be parallel to the substrate surface based on information from polarized UV−vis−NIR, IR transmission, and reflection−absorption spectra. After being transferred onto a mica surface by a single withdrawal, the surface morphologies of the films were found to be uniform or exhibited spongelike domain structures of thickness about 1.8 nm."
"The conductivity of the mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films of tridecylmethylammonium- Au(dmit)2 and icosanoic acid after electrochemical oxidation in LiClO4 aqueous solution was measured under pressure up to 14 kbar. The room-temperature conductivity (σRT=12 S/cm) increased with an increase in pressure reaching 2.85 times larger value at 14 kbar compared to that under ambient pressure. The temperature at which the film exhibits its maximum conductivity was shifted to lower temperature upon applying pressure without pronounced saturation."

"BEDT-TTF (bisethylenediothio-tetrathiafulvalene) derivatives, labeled 1a and 1b, are used to build Langmuir—Blodgett films. In the first step, oxidation by iodine vapor leads in both cases to the formation of radical cation dimers: (1a·+)2 and (b·+)2. However, the subsequent behavior of films strongly depends on the way the aliphatic substituents are grafted onto the electroactive nucleus. Built up films of 1b go back reversibly to their initial insulating state and those of 1a undergo a solid state reorganization leading to a permanent conducting phase. These differences are explained in terms of steric hindrance. Spectroscopical arguments are used to derive the stoichiometry of the conducting films of 1a which is likely to be that of conducting bulk crystals of (BEDT-TTF)2I3−."
"The ESR spectra of conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of N-docosylpyridinium-(TCNQ) 2 are observed at the X and K bands. The spectrum simulation method is adopted to analyze these spectra, which show clear out-of-plane anisotropy, in order to obtain information concerning the magnetic and structural properties of the system. The analysis reveals that the linewidth anisotropy is dominated by the exchange-narrowed secular dipolar width peculiar to quasi one-dimensional spin systems. This result is consistent with the temperature dependent spin susceptibility data of the system, which has been found to be explained by the random-exchange Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain model. These facts indicate the development of one-dimensional spin chains in the LB films. In addition, the orientation of TCNQ molecule is estimated from the spectrum analysis."

"The behaviour of new giant tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) analogues has been studied at the gas/water interface and in Langmuir–Blodgett films. These compounds, denoted G-TTFCn, have a dihydro-TTF core which bears two conjugated side-arms with various alkyl chains (from methyl to octyl). Langmuir films of these compounds are quite stable versus time and are characterized by a collapse pressure that increases as the length of the alkyl chains decreases. The ability of these compounds to form Langmuir films should then be due to their extended TTF core. Except for G-TTFC1, transfer of the monolayer onto a solid substrate is easily done at low surface pressure. Doping of the LB films by iodine vapours changes their spectroscopic (EPR, electronic and vibrational) behaviour and leads to rather poor conducting films. Conductivity of G-TTFC4 films (σRT≈ 4 × 10–7 S cm–1) is two orders of magnitude lower than for G-TTFC2(σRT≈ 4 × 10–4 S cm–1), showing the influence of the molecular packing on the electrical properties of such films. Different results are obtained upon mixing these G-TTFCn compounds with pentadecyltetracyanoquinodimethane (C15TCNQ) in various proportions, which gives rise to charge transfer complexes of adjustable stoichiometry. It is shown that these extended π-donor molecules give new insights on the redox processes that can lead to conducting films."

"Atomic resolution imaging of Langmuir-Blodgett highly-conductive, environmentally-stable organic films of charge-transfer salts has been obtained by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) showing their closely packed structure. By means of a comparative study with images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, the intermolecular distances have been calculated taking into account several types of measurement error. The structural data derived from STM have been compared with those obtained from electron diffraction studies. The electrical properties of these films together with the “read and write” capabilities of STM could provide a basis for fabricating nanoelectronic devices."
"New semifluorinated tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives were prepared and used in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Transfer onto a solid substrate of such pure monolayers can be easily achieved leading to organized LB films in which the fluorinated chains are tilted with respect to the normal of the substrate as demonstrated by infrared and X-ray experiments. Doping of such films by iodine does not induce change in the layer spacing on the contrary to already published studies concerning alkyl derivatives of TTF. Such structural stability and values of the layer thickness suggest some interdigitation between TTF groups within the LB film. Depending on the exact chemical structure of the TTF moiety, the iodination is stabilized or not. When the doped film is stabilized in a mixed valency state, conductivity of approx. 10−2 S cm−1 was measured at room temperature."
"Conducting Langmuir–Blodgett films are one of the candidates for molecular electronics. We investigated the structural and electrical properties of Langmuir–Blodgett films built up as a mixed molecular system of bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene, in short BEDO-TTF, and fatty acid, as a function of (a) the alkyl chain length of the fatty acid and (b) the fatty acid: BEDO-TTF molar ratio in the starting solution from which the Langmuir film is prepared. The Langmuir–Blodgett films deposited from mixtures with molar ratio 1:2 showed better quality in terms of crystallinity and electrical conduction. Moreover, LB films with longer alkyl chain fatty acids were better ordered even at lower molar ratio."

"The synthesis of surfactant 11,11,12,12-tetracyanoanthraquinodimethanes (TCNAQ)(2a–h) with different hydrophilic groups such as amino, sulfonyl and carbonyl at the head of long-chain substituents is described. Highly homogeneous conducting Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films with stable conductivities of 1–5 S cm–1 are obtained when using binary mixtures of surfactant TCNAQ (2c,d,f) as acceptors and surfactant tetrathiafulvalenes as donors."

"Recently a new class of conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films has been generated using M(dmit)2 (M = Au or Ni, H2dmit = 4, 5-dimercapto-1, 3-dithiol-2-thione) as an electron acceptor. One member of this class, the LB film of 3C10-Au(dmit)2 (3C10 = trialkymethylammonium), has after electro-oxidation been reported as the first example of a macroscopically metallic LB film system (σ ≈ 30 S cm−, because of the observed increase in its conductivity with decreasing temperature down to 200 K. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements have been performed on LB films of alkylammonium-M(dmit)2 complexes as well as powder samples. The ESR spectra observed for LB and powder samples are different from each other, suggesting a change in molecular arrangements. ESR spectra are also dependent on the central metal species and the number of alkyl chains. The comparatively low spin density in the electro-oxidized film of 3C10(dmit)2 observed at low temperatures suggests a lower amount of disorder and/or a higher degree of dimensionality of the system than for other conductive LB films of charge transfer complexes reported so far."
"Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films of some surfactant charge transfer salts of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) are deposited and investigated. The introduction of octadecane in monolayers at the gas-water interface allows the deposition of films having good surface morphology and thickness uniformity. With this method exactly one monolayer is transferred to the substrate in every act of dipping and withdrawing. This fact allows us to use the conducting monolayers in complex Langmuir-Blodgett assemblies. The films are studied by electron diffraction. Two crystalline phases are discovered in some multilayers. Only one of these phases appears to be conducting. Introduction of the Li(TCNQ) salt in water solution, which is used for deposition, leads to an increase in conductivity and essentially increases the stability of charge transfer salts at the gas-water interface, diminishing their dissociation."
"Recent progress in the metallic conducting Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films built from TTF derivative and fatty acids is reported. A simple LB method of transferring the mixed Langmuir (L) film of BEDO-TTF (BO) and stearic acid (SA) onto substrates provided metallic conducting LB films. A homogeneous L film formation on the water surface observed by Brewster angle microscope (BAM) is an essential factor for the well-ordered LB films. In the L film, the carboxylate group of fatty acid forms anion layer bringing about a spontaneous formation of mixed valence state (MVS) of BO layer. Similar spontaneous formation was also found in the molecular combination of nonoxygen-substituted donor of EDT-TTF and octadecanesulfonic acid (OS). This type of reaction would be useful for obtaining conducting LB films. For the LB films of BEDO-TTF and stearic acid, we found a negative transverse magnetoresistance at low temperature that was interpreted in the weak localization of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system based on the well-defined conducting layer."
"The behaviour of (N-octadecylpyridinium)–Ni(dmit)2 at the air/water interface has been investigated, and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films have been built up on a variety of substrates. LB layers deposited from freshly spread, floating films are composite structures, containing aggregates of micrometre dimensions. True monolayers are obtained only if the floating film is left for several hours on the subphase surface in its uncompressed state. The spectroscopic and electrical properties of both types of LB film are reported. For the composite layers, stable, in-plane do conductivity values of up to 0.2 S cm–1 are obtained after doping in iodine vapour. However, LB films built up from floating monolayers are not conductive, either in their as-deposited state or following iodine doping."
"Structures consisting of Al/anthracene/Au and Al/(Py)Ni(dmit)2 Langmuir-Blodgett film/anthracene/Au have been constructed and their electrical and opto-electrical properties compared. The current vs. voltage characteristics of the simple anthracene structure were found to be symmetric for both polarities of applied bias. However, significant rectification (greater than 103) was observed in the device containing the (Py)Ni(dmit)2. Short-lived electroluminescence was also observed for this device with a forward bias of 50 V."
"The new tetrathiafulvalene derivative1, functionalised with an azobenzene substituent, has been synthesised. Cyclic voltammetric and spectroelectrochemical studies in solution demonstrate the reversible formation of the radical cation of 1. UV–VIS spectroscopy suggests that there is a weak interaction between the TTF and azobenzene moieties in compound 1, and demonstrates that trans–cis isomerisation occurs upon photolysis of the azobenzene substituent. Semi-conducting LB films of 1 have been assembled without the need for added fatty acid: room temperature conductivity values of the films before and after doping with iodine vapour were σrt=10–3–10–5 S cm–1 and 2×10–2–10–3 S cm–1 , respectively. No change in the conductivity of the LB films was observed under irradiation."

"Films containing TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) anions were prepared by incorporating it from a LiTCNQ aqueous subphase. The TCNQ moiety was transferred from the subphase as the counterion of a positively charged monolayer of DPOP+ (diphenylbis(octadecylamino)phosphonium). The isotherm shape, the area per molecule, the collapse pressure, and the monolayer stability were dependent on the LiTCNQ concentration in the subphase. The obtained Langmuir–Blodgett films were classified into three types depending on the TCNQ oxidation state. The oxidation state depends on the transference pressure as well as on the monolayer age. The degree of both order and architecture of the films was studied by means of SEM, IR, UV–vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Conductivity studies were also performed."
"This paper presents the detection performances of low-conducting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, based on tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetrathiofulvalene (TTF) derivatives, towards nitrogen dioxide (NO2). TTF-based LB films appear to be more sensitive than TCNQ ones, and well adapted to the detection of low concentrations. The detection mechanism is clearly established for TCNQ LB films, but is still unclear for LB films based on TTF."
"The Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique can deposit a soft coating without damaging the substrate. Thus, the technique is appropriate for coating fragile materials such as nano-structures and biomaterials. We fabricated electrical contacts on a dodecanethiol self-assembled monolayer (C12 SAM) using metallic conductive LB films of BEDO-TTF/stearic acid. We then prepared a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) junction, in which the C12 SAM was sandwiched between the LB films and Au surface. The current–voltage characteristics across the MIM junction exhibited nonlinear behavior, which suggests that tunneling is the dominant conduction mechanism. The tunneling characteristic parameters calculated using the Simmons tunneling model were in agreement with previous reports. These results show that metallic conductive LB films can serve as a soft electrode for use with delicate materials."
"The behaviour of tetrabutylammonium–Ni(dmit)2 at the air–water interface has been investigated and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films have been built-up on a variety of substrates from the floating layer containing different concentrations of tricosanoic acid. The morphology, spectroscopic, electrical, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties of the LB films are reported. In-plane dc room-temperature conductivity values of σrt= 10–2 S cm–1 and thermal activation energies ΔE= 0.08–0.1 eV over the temperature range 300–100 K, have been achieved by post-deposition electrochemical doping with four different anions, and by chemical doping with iodine vapour. The films doped with iodine and perchlorate retained this conductivity value upon storage for ca. 1 month. Electrochemical doping during deposition of the LB films resulted in conductivity values of σrt= 10–3 S cm–1."
"Abstract Highly conductive Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films were obtained by the pyrolysis of polyimide LB films at 1000 °C in vacuum or under nitrogen atmosphere. The films showed the conductivity of as high as 300 S/cm, depending on the thickness of the film. The highest conductivity so far obtained was 600 S/cm. The film was stable under ambient conditions over months."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) assemblies composed of monolayers of different compounds alternating in a predetermined sequence are potential candidates for development in the field of nanoelectronics. However, their poor mechanical stability restricts the possibility of fabrication of interconnected electronic elements because LB films can be easily destroyed during the deposition of metal electrodes. In this work, we present a technique for the fabrication of junctions for the electrical characterization of one-component LB films and LB assemblies enclosed between thin molecular electrodes. The molecular electrodes are produced using LB films of a charge-transfer salt. Such an application of these films became possible due to considerable improvements in their conductivity, quality of deposition and stability in comparison with the properties of films of similar compositions studied previously. Lateral patterning of electrodes is carried out by the irradiation of conductive films with an electron beam, which results in the loss of their conductivity. In this way, it is possible to prepare the samples for electrical investigations without any damage to incorporated LB films. The LB films of barium stearate, polycyanoacrylate, mixture of surfactant donor and acceptor, porphyrins, as well as the LB assemblies composed of thin layers of these compounds deposited in various sequences were enclosed between the molecular electrodes and studied. Probable conduction mechanisms are discussed on the basis of obtained data."

"The sensitivity of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the co-ordination polymer poly(CuMBSH) to organic vapours has been investigated using electrical impedance spectroscopy. The films were exposed to benzene, ethanol, acetonitrile and water vapours. In all cases, a reversible change in the capacitance and conductance of the LB film was observed. The effects of water vapour are shown to be different from those observed with the organic vapours."
"Recent progress in metallic Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films is reported. First, we review several highly-conducting LB films focusing on the choice of donor molecules, DC conductivity and infrared absorption. From the above, difficulties in the fabrication of metallic LB films based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives are summarized. Among them, it is discussed comparatively that the mixing of an oxygen substituted TTF-type donor bis-ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene (BEDO-TTF) and behenic acid provides metallic LB films, which clearly exhibit a metallic temperature dependence of DC resistivity without any remarkable trace of percolation at low temperatures."
"The structure and physical properties of highly conductive Langmuir-Blodgett films of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (3C10-Au) are described. The layered structure of the film was revealed by X-ray diffraction method. The d-spacing was 1.9 and 2.7 nm for the film before and after oxidation, respectively. The conductivity of the LB films of 3C10-Au after oxidation was 30 – 50 S/cm at room temperature, showing a metallic temperature dependence down to around 150 K."
"Abstract Conductivity switching was observed in the LB films of supermolecules having phenylazonaphthalene, alkyl chains, and pyridinium(TCNQ)2 as switching, transmission, and working units. respectively.

"The structure of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of N-docosylpyridinium- tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) 1:2 charge transfer salt was studied. The polarized spectra of the film in the UV-visible region showed no in-plane anisotropy, which is consistent with the results of direct observation of the film by polarized microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The absorption bands owing to the TCNQ appear in the UV-visible region and showed the distinct blue shift compared with that of the powder sample. This fact was explained well by the difference between the energy of three-dimensional solids and the quasi-two- dimensional LB system using a Hubbard-like model. The striking feature of the spectra of the LB film was the strong absorption band which appeared at 32×103 cm−1. The transition direction of this band was the direction of the long axis of the TCNQ molecular plane and proved to be normal to the thin surface. The TCNQ molecules had their short axis parallel and long axis perpendicular to the film plane. The polarized IR spectra were also consistent with the UV-visible spectra."
"Based on the unique nature of bisethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene (BO), a stable, highly conductive Langmuir-Blodgett film was developed using a charge-transfer (CT) complex of BO and dimethoxytetracyanoquinodimethane ((MeO) 2 TCNQ). A clear negative temperature-derivative of the conductivity was observed down to 180 K, indicating the establishment of the macroscopic metallic conduction. The paramagnetic spin susceptibility indicates that the metallic phase is retained down to 50 K and the CT complex molecules are highly oriented in the stacking direction."

"The Hall effect of a metallic Langmuir–Blodgett film based on bisethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene complex of decyltetracyanoquinodimethane has been investigated using a double ac Hall method. The polarity of the Hall coefficient is positive over the measuring temperature range. The carrier density is of the order of 1021 cm−3, almost independent of temperature, and the Hall mobility, of around 0.05 cm2 (V s)−1 at room temperature, is in a single activated process. The Hall results have been interpreted with an inhomogeneous structure model, and support that metallic domains are developed throughout the whole sample."
"We have found that the intermolecular spacing of an arachidic acid (C20) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film can be controlled by introducing a variable amount of spacer molecules such as fullerene (C60) into the film. Using this characteristic, several kinds of mixed LB films, composed of C20 and C60, were prepared and the adsorption characteristics of gas molecules, namely phytoncid (e.g. limonene, α-pinene), to these films were studied using a quartz crystal microbalance. The dependence of the amount of the gas adsorbed on the number of layers reveal that the permeability of the gas molecules into the LB films remarkably increases with an increase of the intermolecular spacing of LB films. Gas molecules with different sizes or structures were sifted by using C60 containing LB films. This characteristic of the LB films containing C60 can be applied to a novel gas sensor with a molecular sifter function."
"N-octadecylviologen-TCNQ−2 salt (OV-(TCNQ)2) was synthesized and identified by its characteristic NMR peaks. Charge transfer absorption of the TCNQ anion radical was observed at 600$̃900 nm and the intramolecular transition of TCNQ anion radical was observed at 400 nm in a methylene chloride-acetonitrile (1:1) mixture. A significant shift in electronic transition was observed for a Langmuir-Blodgett film layered with OV-(TCNQ)2; 600 nm for the dimer and 380 nm for TCNQ anion absorption. The take-off area of OV-(TCNQ)2 was 180 Å2 molecule−1 and the limiting area was 145 Å2 molecule−1 at the surface pressure of 25 mN m−1. Spectroscopic ellipsometry shows that the one-layer thickness of OV-(TCNQ)2 on a Si wafer is 35 Å. The thickness indicates that both aromatic rings of octadecylviologen are attached on the solid surface. The electrical conductivity of five-layer OV-(TCNQ)2 was 1.02 × 10−8 S cm−1."
"The cyclodextrin fragment was persubstituted with pendant redox-active tetrathiafulvalene moieties. These molecular assemblies allow an efficient access to Langmuir-Blodgett films of tetrathiafulvalene derivatives, independently of their hydrophobic character."
"A new TTF derivative tetrakis(hexadecylthio)-tetrathiafulvalene (THT-TTF) as a Langmuir-Blodgett film material is synthesized. The molecular behavior at the air-water interface is studied by admixture different molar numbers of stearic acid (SA) and a possible molecular reorganization is discussed according to the occupied area per THT-TTF molecule at different SA molar numbers. THT-TTF molecules form dimers, monolayer and intermediate. The ultraviolet (UV) spectra prove this point quantitatively. After iodine oxidation, THT-TTF is not oxidized completely to the cation radical THT-TTF+ from Raman spectra. The formation of triiodide chains has been proved by Raman spectra and UV absorption spectra. Intercalation of the triiodide chain in the bilayers induces the alkyl chains rearrangement and a large reduction in layer thickness. The investigation of conductivities shows that the conductivities are proportional to the THT-TTF molar fraction and that there is a small percolation threshold at Φ∗ = 0.50, which means that THT-TTF is a 2D molecular system. The maximum conductivity reaches 0.9 S cm−1."
"We study an electrochemical method of obtaining conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films as radical cation salts of dialkylthioethylenedithiotetrathiofulvalence (TTF) derivatives.

"Molecular assemblies were studied at the air-water interface, as were neutral and oxidized Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films in the mixed (1: n) molecular system of EDTTTF (SC18)2 (EDTTTF, ethylenedithiodioctadecylthiotetrathiafulvalene) and behenic acid (CH3(CH2)20 COOH). At the air-water interface, a possible molecular organization was discussed from the study of the area occupied by EDTTTF (SC18)2 and n molar fraction of behenic acid at a surface pressure of 30 mN m-1. EDTTTF (SC18)2 molecules form dimers and with increasing behenic acid content, a monolayer reorganization occurs. The formation of monomolecular layers including monomer EDTTTF (SC18)2 molecules was achieved for n>or=2. X-ray diffraction studies were concentrated on samples of Y-type LB multilayered films with n=0, 1 and 3. Throughout the mixed (1:n) system, stacking periodicity was dominantly observed from (001) reflections as 55+or-1 AA for neutral films, 72+or-1 AA for a brown-coloured film after exposure to iodine, and 46+or-1 AA for the stable, conducting and purple-coloured film after a thermal activation process. Possible molecular assemblies based upon centrosymmetrical bilayers were qualitatively discussed based on the calculation of the linear electron density profiles of pure and doped EDTTTF (SC18)2 LB films. The large variation of the stacking periodicity during the oxidation process was explained by the molecular inclination of EDTTTF (SC18)2 molecule associated with the insertion of I3- ions which intercalate between EDTTTF (SC18)2 layers."
"The behavior of 5,5′-methylenebis(N-hexadecylsalicylideneamine) at the air/water interface has been investigated using Brewster angle microscopy and surface pressure versus area measurements. Langmuir—Blodgett (LB) films have been built up on a variety of substrates. The addition of copper acetate to the subphase causes a change in both the physical and optical properties of the LB layers. Film thickness data suggest that a true monolayer (thickness ∼2 nm) is formed only under these conditions. The multilayer films have been studied using X-ray diffraction, UV/visible spectroscopy, ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance. Films have also been exposed to low benzene concentrations (300 vapor parts per million) and changes in their optical properties recorded using surface plasmon resonance."
"Amphiphilic bis(tetrathiafulvalene) derivative 1 has been synthesized and assembled into Langmuir-Blodgett multilayers which, upon doping with iodine, afford stable semiconducting thin films of a mixed-valence salt, with in-plane roomtemperature conductivity, σrt= 10–3σ cm–1."
"The electric conductivities of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films and cast films of octadecyltetracyanoquinodimethane (C18TCNQ), N-docosylpyridinium-TCNQn (C22PyTCNQn; n=1,2) and N-octadecylpyridinium-TCNQ2 (C18PyTCNQ2) with various mixed valent states were measured using patterned gold microelectrodes as the substrates of these thin films. The conductivity of the 1:1 mixed LB film of C18TCNQ and methyl arachidate (MA), whose mixed valency was controlled by the constant-potential electrolysis, changed drastically with the mixed valency of the film, and reached a maximum value when it was electrolyzed at -0.1 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), i.e. the oxidation-reduction potential of the LB film. The electric conductivity of the cast films of C22PyTCNQ2 and (1⩽x⩽2), which were prepared by the mixed solution of C22PyTCNQ2 and C22PyTCNQ, increased about four orders from x=1 to x=2, and has its largest values at x=2. The electron spin resonance spectra of the 1:1 mixed LB films of C18TCNQ and MA electrolyzed at several electrode potentials were measured. The dependences of the linewidths of the LB films on the angle between the direction of the static magnetic field and that normal to the film were different from one anther, and depended on the temperature. The result was discussed in terms of the electron exchange rate in the LB films."
"Thermoelectric power and electrical conductivity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit) 2 have been measured in the temperature range of 300 to 125 K. The conductivity in the lateral direction of the LB films is 30 S/cm at room temperature. The conductivity increases down to around 200 K, and decreases below that temperature. The thermoelectric power is positive and its temperature dependence shows a metallic behavior in the temperature range measured. The average value in thermoelectric power at room temperature is 20 µV/K."

The molecules of C18TCNQ can form a stable monolayer at the air-water interface. Anisotropy of conductivity was observed in the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films.

"A conducting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film containing a charge transfer complex, tetrabenzylthiotetrathiafulvalene-Zn (dmit)2 (TBTTTF-Zn(dmit)2), where H2(dmit) is 4,5-dimercapto-1,3-dithiol-2-thione, is described. Monolayers at the air-water interface were formed by adding stearic acid (SA) to the semiamphiphilic complex. This was transferred onto solid substrates with SA for IR, UV and conductivity measurements. The thickness per layer was 2.51 nm. The LB films were oxidized with iodine. The maximum conductivities parallel and perpendicular to the LB film were 4.3×10−1 S cm−1 and 10−3 S cm−1 respectively. The LB film exhibited anisotropy of conductivity.."
"The pressure-area isotherms of mono- and divalent octadecylpyridinium M(dmit)2 charge transfer salts (M = Au, Pd, or Pt) are presented and the behaviour contrasted with previously reported results for tetraalkylammonium M(dmit)2 salts. The current voltage characteristics of Y-type Langmuir-Blodgett films of both salts showed similar behaviour upon doping with bromine or iodine vapour. Immediately upon doping the conductivity of the films increased by many orders of magnitude but within a few hours this enhanced conductivity had decreased to an almost stable value which was still several orders of magnitude greater than in the undoped film. Interestingly, in this state the current-voltage characteristic showed a clear square-law behaviour. Within a day or two, however, the contribution of this process to the overall conductivity decreased to reveal a stable ohmic behaviour from which the film conductivity was estimated to be 0.06 S m−1."
"A novel mixed Langmuir Blodgett (LB) film based on a 1:1 (molar ratio) mixture of a non-amphiphile complex (Et4N)2[Zn(dmit)2] (H2dmit = 4,5-dimercapto-1,3-dithiole-2-thione) and Schiff base amphiphile 2,4-dihydroxy-N-octadecylbenzylideneamine (SBC18) was constructed and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and UV-vis electronic absorption spectra. After iodine was doped in situ, magnitude of charge transfer increases, which was demonstrated by FTIR and UV-vis absorption spectral analysis."
"In this paper we report information on the spreading isotherms and the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of mono- and multilayer films built up with long hydrocarbon chain nitroxides (namely doxyl stearic acid and hexadecanoyl- piperidine-oxyl radicals). These ultrathin molecular assemblies were prepared from (i) single components, (ii) nitroxide binary mixtures, and (iii) a diluted solution of the paramagnetic components in a diamagnetic (stearic acid) host. The spreading isotherms allowed us to establish that the presence of a five- or six-membered ring in the hydrocarbon chain rendered the film more expanded, and this effect depended on the substituent position in the chain. The ESR spectra of undiluted nitroxides were characterized by strong spin-spin (dipole-dipole and Heisenberg spin exchange) magnetic interactions whose extent also depended on the nitroxide type and mixture. The calculation of the parameters of motion governing the ESR lineshape allowed accurate evaluation both of the degree of order and of the chain flexibility, particularly for diamagnetically diluted systems."

"The Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film based on ditetradecyldimethylammonium-Au(dmit)2 (dmit = 1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate) [2C14N+Me2-Au(dmit)2] salt exhibits a high room-temperature conductivity of 40 S/cm (4.0 × 103 S/m) after electro-oxidation. Since the optical transmittance of the 20-layered LB film is more than 80 % in the whole visible region, the thin-film system attracts much attention both from the technological and scientific point of views. Although the electro-oxidation plays a key role to realize the high conductivity, the induced changes in structure and properties of the film had not been fully elucidated. Here we present a comprehensive study on the structure and properties of the 2C14N+Me2-Au(dmit)2 LB film utilizing UV–visible spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, AFM and XRD. The oxidation of the Au(dmit)2 anions solely proceeds in the earlier stage, while the anion oxidation and a morphological change proceed simultaneously in the later stage. Associated with the electro-oxidation, a broad band appears in a wide IR region and the change in the spectral weight [Δ∫Adk(cm−1)] coincides well with the conductance indicating that conduction electrons are generated by the charge transfer. The order of the hydrocarbon chains improves by the electro-oxidation. The as-deposited film consists of insulating domains with d = 3.2 nm, while the insulating domains with d = 3.2 nm and highly conductive domains with d = 2.9 nm coexist in the electro-oxidized film. The heterogeneity is considered to be the origin of the percolation-type conduction."
"N-octadecylviologen-TCNQ−2 salt (OV-(TCNQ)2) was synthesized and identified by its characteristic NMR peaks. Charge transfer absorption of the TCNQ anion radical was observed at 600$̃900 nm and the intramolecular transition of TCNQ anion radical was observed at 400 nm in a methylene chloride-acetonitrile (1:1) mixture. A significant shift in electronic transition was observed for a Langmuir-Blodgett film layered with OV-(TCNQ)2; 600 nm for the dimer and 380 nm for TCNQ anion absorption. The take-off area of OV-(TCNQ)2 was 180 Å2 molecule−1 and the limiting area was 145 Å2 molecule−1 at the surface pressure of 25 mN m−1. Spectroscopic ellipsometry shows that the one-layer thickness of OV-(TCNQ)2 on a Si wafer is 35 Å. The thickness indicates that both aromatic rings of octadecylviologen are attached on the solid surface. The electrical conductivity of five-layer OV-(TCNQ)2 was 1.02 × 10−8 S cm−1."

"The structure and electrical transport properties of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polyimide are described. The highly conductive LB films were obtained by the pyrolysis of polyimide LB films at 1000°C in vacuum or under nitrogen atmosphere. The films showed the conductivity of as high as 300 S/cm, depending on the thickness of the precursor films. The surface of the film was smooth and uniform revealed by SEM. The films were stable under ambient conditions over months."
"ESR measurements were performed on Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of 1:2 complex of long-chain pyridinium and TCNQ, where the long chain contains photo-active azobenzene group. Observed temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility is consistent with the formation of the random-exchange Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains in the system."
"Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed on conducting Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films constructed from bis-ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene (BO) and behenic acid (BA). The temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility and the line width showed a metallic behavior of conduction electron on the BO network, which is consistent with the negative temperature-derivative of DC conductivity observed previously. The orientation of BO molecule in the films is estimated from the anisotropy of the g-value."
"Monolayer films of an amphiphilic one-electron bis-pyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (BP) donor do not complex with organic acceptors; a hydrophobic BP donor forms no monolayer films by itself, but forms Langmuir-Blodgett films when complexed with TCNQ, TCNQF4, and DDQ; one of them is an anisotropic semiconductor (conductivity about 10−4 S/cm in the film plane)."

"Metallic conducting Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films were used as soft electrodes to fabricate molecular junctions with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols (CH3(CH2)n − 1SH) on an Au surface. Alkanethiols can form highly ordered, stable dielectric SAMs on metal surfaces over large areas. However, it is difficult to establish electrical contacts on such SAMs, which has limited their application. In this work, we used metallic conducting LB films composed of bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene and stearic acid as a soft electrode onto alkanethiol SAMs (Cn-SAM, n = 12, 14, 16, 18) to prepare Au/SAM/metal junctions of relatively large size (~ 15.6 × 103 μm2). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics across the junctions exhibited rectifying behavior with a ratio R of ~ 5 (R = |J(V)|/|J(− V)| at ± 1 V). The lower transfer rate corresponding to the electron transport from Au to the LB films exhibited nonlinear J–V characteristics, while the higher transfer rate of electrons from the LB film to Au showed linear J–V characteristics. Kelvin probe force microscopy revealed that the work function of the metallic LB films was smaller than that of Au. The observed rectification behavior is probably caused by different electron transport mechanisms between the two current directions."

"X-Ray absorption and diffraction have been used to study a Langmuir-Blodgett film of an iodine-intercalated charge transfer (CT) salt based on EDT-TTF(SC18)2. The polarized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of I3− exhibits a strong angular dependence of the 2s–5p(σ∗) resonance intensity. To obtain precise information about the I3− orientation, the observed polarization dependence is compared with the theoretical calculation. It is shown that the I3− molecular axes are distributed randomly in a plane parallel to the substrate. From the viewpoint of the I3− distribution, the effect of annealing is also investigated with polarized XANES spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. It is confirmed that an annealing process is necessary to achieve a well-stabilized and highly conducting film of the present CT salt. In addition, a possible molecular assembly of this annealed purple phase is proposed via a simulation of the X-ray diffraction profile based on the XANES results."
"Two kinds of complexes of unsymmetrical alkylthiotetrathiafulvalene and alkylammonium-metal (dmit)2 were synthesized. Their Langmuir-Blodgett films have been deposited by vertical dipping method.

"The monolayers and LB films of BEDO-TTF · CF3TCNQ charge transfer (CT) complex mixed with matrix molecule, arachidic acid, were prepared. A strong CT band was observed in the IR region due to the conduction electron. The average charges of the CF3TCNQ and BEDO-TTF in the LB film were −1 and +0.5, respectively, determined from the shift of the bands in IR region. The LB film showed a metal-like conductivity at around room temperature."
"Infrared (IR) external reflection absorption spectroscopy was applied to study the structure and its change associated with iodine doping of a Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) film of a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative, 1,3-dithiole-4-carboxylic acid-2-(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)hexadecyl ester (HDTTF, Figure 1), prepared on a silicon wafer. The incidence angle (φ) dependence of the p- and s-polarized IR external reflection spectra were measured and analyzed by a theoretical calculation of reflection absorbance (Ap and As) as a function of the tilt angle of the transition moment of each IR band with an assumed complex refractive index. The results indicated that the LB film before doping consists of cis and trans structures, which have the CO bonds with cis and trans configurations, respectively, with respect to the neighboring CC bond of the TTF ring. The TTF ring in both structures are almost perpendicular to the substrate surface with the central CC bond parallel to the surface. After iodine doping the LB film consists of the cis structure and gives rise to charge-transfer-induced vibronic bands at 1352 and 1252 cm-1. The analyses of the φ dependence of Ap of these bands proved that the transition moments of both bands make a tilt angle of about 70° with respect to the surface normal of the substrate, which is consistent with a face-to-face stacking of the TTF rings nearly perpendicular to the surface and the high conduction parallel to the substrate."
"Abstract Based upon the synthesis of 3,4,5-tris(alkylthio)-1,2-dithiolium cation salts, we have realized new Langmuir–Blodgett films.

"A metallic temperature dependence of the resistance of ditetradecyldimethylammonium–Au(dmit)2 [2C14–Au(dmit)2] Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film is observed in a wide temperature range of 56–293 K. While a weak metallic temperature dependence of resistance has been observed down to 216 K in a case where the electrode gap for the measurement is 0.5 mm (500 µm), an unambiguous metallic behavior is observed down to 56 K when utilizing a narrower interdigitated gap of 5 µm for the measurement."
"Abstract Single-component Langmuir–Blodgett films of a dithiolate complex [Au(tmdt)2] (tmdt2− = bis(methylthio)tetrathiafulvalenedithiolate) were prepared. The as-grown films were insulating, which became semiconducting with the activation energy of 0.05 eV after electrochemical doping."

"The electrical conductivity of electrochemically oxidized Langmuir-Blodgett films of tridecylmethylammonium-Au(dmit${)}_{2}$ and icosanoic acid has been studied. The measurements were performed at temperatures down to 3 K and hydrostatic pressures up to 17 kbar, and also at high electric fields up to 3.2 kV/cm. The results support the view that the films consist of relatively large metallic islands, separated by thin barriers, and indicate that the low-temperature conductivity with d\ensuremath{\sigma}/dT&gt;0 originates from thermal-fluctuation-induced tunneling. At higher temperatures d\ensuremath{\sigma}/dT0 because of the finite resistance of the metallic islands. The conductivity increased upon applied pressure, and the temperature of the maximum conductivity shifted to lower temperature without any pronounced saturation. The ambient-pressure room-temperature conductivity of the best conducting samples could be increased by a factor of about 2 at 10-kbar hydrostatic pressure and further to 140 S/cm at the temperature of the maximum conductivity at 51 K."
"An alkylated N , N ′ -dicyanoquinonediimine (alkylDCNQI) derivative has been synthesized and the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique has been applied to this material and its mixture with CuI, aiming at the construction of a DCNQI-Cu system in two dimensions. No chemical reaction could be detected for alkylDCNQI-CuI mixed solutions. However, optical measurements have shown that the LB films obtained from the mixture contain a partially reduced DCNQI group, suggesting that a new CT complex is obtained by in situ reaction of alkylDCNQI and CuI at the air-water interface."
"The first preparation of stable monomolecular layers at the air–water interface and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films containing the title compound are described; after exposure to iodine vapour the LB films exhibit an in-plane conductivity of 1.2 × 10–4 S cm–1."
"The crossed polarized-light microscopy has revealed that the as-deposited LB film of the 2C14–Au(dmit)2 salt consists of giant domains of several hundred microns, which have a uni-axial molecular arrangement. By the electrochemical oxidation, the giant domains disappear and smaller domains of 5–10 μm appear. According to the atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation, the as-deposited film consists of domains of several microns but it appears that the observed domains are fragments formed by cracks generated in much larger domains, as seen by the shapes. It is hypothesized that there exist giant domains at the air/water interface but cracks are made during the transfer process. Thus, the uni-axial molecular arrangement is kept over the macroscopic range. Considering the random potentials set up by grain boundaries and/or defects, fabrication of the crack-free LB film is considered to be indispensable for realizing metallic properties down to much lower temperatures and global superconductivity."
"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of (tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene)3-(tetradecyltetracyanoquinodimethane)2 exhibit a high bulk conductivity and a metallic nature inside the domains in the system has already been suggested. The characteristic temperature dependence of the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal was observed for this system and the possible occurrence of Peierls fluctuations around 150 K has been reported. These fluctuations can be characterized by the maximum of the temperature-dependent ESR linewidth. We report here that the maximum of the linewidth is reversibly changed by the total pressure of the atmosphere in which the samples were sealed. A dependence on sealing gas species could not be detected, suggesting that chemical processes are not responsible for the anomalous behaviour of the linewidth. This phenomenon may be related to the flexible layered structure, which is characteristic of LB films."
"Abstract We report the conducting properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films obtained by mixing BEDO-TTF with various molecules. Conductivity was observed when BEDO-TTF was mixed with fatty acids and a phosphate. On the other hand, the association of BEDO-TTF and docosanol led to insulating properties. This suggests that the polar head group of the amphiphilic molecules contributes to the partial charge-transfer process of BEDO-TTF."
"In this paper, we present a study of the preparation of Langmuir-Blodgett films of polymers obtained on a trough from mixtures made by pyrrole derivatives. In particular, the comparison between films obtained by different molar ratios of 3-hexadecyl-pyrrole to pure pyrrole is shown, in terms of the kinetics of the process and of the compressibility of the products obtained. Depending on the molar ratio in the composition of the mixtures, differences have been found in the structure of the co-polymer obtained and in the behaviour of the resulting film."
"Surface pressure-area curves for the perfluoroalkanes C16F34, C20F42 and C24F50 showed that monolayers were formed on the sur water. The monolayers of C20F42 and C24F30 were deposited on various substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique; LB films on hydrophobized mica show excellent water repellency with contact angles of water of 155 ° and 153 ° respectively. It was shown by comparison of the reflection-absorption and transmission IR spectra that difluoromethylene chains in the perfluoroalkane LB films are oriented perpen- dicular to the substrate."
"Hybrid Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films were fabricated by transferring pure monolayers of an azobenzene derivative having a TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) moiety (APT) and then 1:1 mixed monolayers of cyanine/APT on solid substrates. The hybrid LB films have binary output modes. The alternate irradiation of UV and visible light yielded reversible cis-trans isomerization of APT, which was accompanied by the electrical conductivity switching associated with APT molecules and the change in the optical properties of the films due to the development of the J-band of the cyanine dye (CY). The order of the sequential deposition of the APT pure monolayers and the 1:1 mixed monolayers of CY/APT plays an important role in realizing the hybrid LB films with binary output modes."

"A mixed semiconducting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film based on a new asymmetrical tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative and arachidic acid is described. The LB film of the 1:1 (molar ratio) mixture of the TTF derivative dibenzylthio-dimethylthio-tetrathiafulvalene with arachidic acid was constructed and characterized by FT-IR and UV spectra, and X-ray diffraction. Measurement on conductivity of the mixed LB film relating to the number of layers showed that the conductivity of the film decreased with increasing layer number. After iodine oxidation the conductivity of the LB film increased by 2–3 orders of magnitude compared with that before iodine doping and reached a maximum of 2.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 due to the formation of a new conducting phase, as demonstrated by FT-IR and UV spectral analyses. Results from X-ray diffraction indicate that the as-deposited LB film has an ordered lamellar structure with a thickness per layer of 2.41 nm."

"The molecular orientation in Langmuir-Blodgett films of a 3:2 charge-transfer complex of tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and tetradecyltetracyanoquinodimethane [(TMTTF)3(C14TCNQ)2] is discussed from the observed anisotropic ESR spectra at the K and X bands. Anisotropy of g values shows the existence of in-plane preferential orientation of the complex with the pπ orbital axis and long axis of the TMTTF molecules parallel and perpendicular to the dipping direction of the substrate, respectively. The effect of aging on ESR spectra of the system is also reported. The decrease in the difference in linewidth at the K and X bands observed for the external magnetic field normal to the film plane indicates the reduction in the degree of misorientation of the molecules by aging."
"A tetrathiafulvalene derivative — tetrabenzylthiotetrathiafulvalene (TBT-TTF) — is a new material for a conducting Langmuir-Blodgett film. A 1:1 molar mixture with stearic acid was built up to obtain a conducting LB film. The conductivities of this mixed LB film were calculated from experimental results before and after iodine oxidation. To understand the increase in conductivity after iodine oxidation, the IR electronic absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction were investigated. The IR results suggest that the system undergoes continuous free chemical reactions after iodine oxidation. TBT-TTF forms the radical cation dimers associated with I3−. Finally, interaction of this new charge transfer complex (TBT-TTF)x(I3−)1−x (x < 1), gives rise to a new conducting LB film with the highest conductivity (4.7 × 10−2 S cm−1). However, the conducting phase is unstable. The LB film can be oxidized repeatedly by iodine vapour. This is a possible application for gas sensors. The result of X-ray diffraction demonstrates that the molecular reorganization occurs because of tri-iodine chains in the bilayer."
"The change of intermolecular spin exchange interaction within a half-filled band of two-dimensional Langmuir films formed by photoresponsive radicals has been investigated theoretically. The photoswitching of magnetic properties arises as a result of a reversible photochemical reaction within the building units of the Langmuir films. These units consist of a photochromic moiety connected with a polymethine radical. The various contributions to the Heisenberg effective exchange integral, the direct (Coulomb), kinetic, and indirect spin exchange, have been calculated using the band theory of organic open-shell π-electron systems."
"Abstract A strategy leading to the formation of conducting LB films without any doping treatment is investigated. The method consists of mixing, within the same layer, semi‐amphiphilic and amphiphilic derivatives of the same electroactive nucleus (here Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)). LB films obtained in this way with the sulphonium TCNQ salt as the semi‐amphiphilic molecule and the octadecyl TCNQ as the amphiphilic one in the molecular ratio 1 to 2, are of high optical quality. Such films show a d.c. conductivity which is almost constant with variation in the number of layers, down to one bilayer. Preliminary results obtained by changing the nature of the counterion in the semi‐amphiphilic molecule are in good agreement with those of the sulphonium TCNQ‐octadecyl TCNQ 0 ."

"Orientational ordering processes of liquid crystalline 4-n-pentyl-4′-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) were studied by the optical second-harmonic generation measurements, in-situ, during evaporation onto silica substrates coated with n-layer polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett films (n = 1, 3, 5, or 11). It was found that the polar orientational order, S1 = 〈cos θ〉, of 5CB decreases as the thickness of polyimide layer increases from 0.4 nm to 2 nm, and then it saturates. It was shown that the electrostatic potential energy calculated with consideration of mirror-image charges at the interface accounts for the orientational order dependence on the polyimide layer thickness."

"Electrical impedance measurements over the frequency range 10 Hz to 1 MHz are reported for fatty acid Langmuir - Blodgett (LB) films containing an organometallic tetrabutylammonium Ni(dmit) complex. Experiments were undertaken using both in-plane and out-of-plane electrode configurations. In the latter case, a relationship between the AC conductivity and frequency of the form was found, with n = 0.51 for a film containing a 0.31 molar fraction of fatty acid. This n value was found to decrease with an increase in the amount of the charge-transfer compound. For the in-plane AC measurements, the conductance of the sample was dominated by the DC conductivity of the LB film."

"In this paper, we discuss a useful technique to fabricate patterned single layers consisting of quantum dots on two-dimensional templates fabricated from phase-separated mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The phase-separated structures are governed by two competing interactions-line tension and dipole-dipole interaction-and are tunable by adjusting the intermolecular interactions between the film-forming molecules and the fabrication conditions. The templates can be fabricated from mixed LB films containing silane-coupling agents, which form covalent bonds with Si wafers. The CdS- or CdSe/ZnS-nanoparticles were immobilized on the templates using a chemisorption technique. The samples were analyzed using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. The diameters of the CdS-NPs and CdSe/ZnS were estimated to be about 2.6 and 4.5 nm, respectively, using the Brus equation. We successfully obtained a patterned single layer consisting of quantum dots on the templates. The density of the immobilized-CdSe/ZnS-NPs on these templates can be controlled through variations in the concentration of the aqueous dispersion of CdSe/ZnS-NPs. Fluorescence observations indicate that the immobilized-CdSe/ZnS-NPs on the templates serve as light-emitting devices. These results indicate that patterned quantum dots can be formed only through self-assembly processes."
"ABSTRACT Mixed films of a polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon 1-pyrene-carboxaldehyde (PyCHO) and a polymer matrix, viz. isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were studied at the air–water interface by surface pressure versus area per molecule (π-A) isotherms. The diagrams obtained by plotting the mean area per molecule as a function of the molar fraction of PyCHO showed positive deviations from ideal conditions with a small exception indicating a repulsive type of interaction between PyCHO and PMMA molecules, resulting in the formation of aggregates. Spectroscopic as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that aggregates were present when the mixed film was transferred onto quartz substrates at different mole ratios of PyCHO."
"Magnetic Langmuir–Blodgett films of ferritin have been prepared by using the adsorption properties of a 1/4 mixed monolayer of eicosylamine (EA) and methyl stearate (SME). BAM images show that a more homogeneous distribution of ferritin at the air–water interface is achieved by using this mixture of surfactants instead of the DODA/SME mixed matrix of a previous work. Transfer of the monolayer onto different substrates allowed the preparation of multilayer LB films. Infrared and UV–Vis spectroscopies indicate that ferritin molecules are incorporated within the LB films. Furthermore, UV–Vis spectroscopy measurements reveal that the amount of ferritin incorporated into these LB film has been increased with respect to that in the DODA/SME LB films. Finally magnetic measurements confirm that the superparamagnetic properties of this molecule are preserved in the LB films."

The π-A isotherm confirms the formation of stable Langmuir films of CA mixed with either PMMA or SA at air–water interface. Characteristics of area per molecule versus molefraction and collapse pressure versus molefraction reveal complete demixing of CA and the matrix PMMA/SA molecules in the mixed films. Absorption spectroscopy certainly confirms the fact that CA molecules have preferred orientation on the substrate of the LB films."
"Magnetic field influence on mono- and multilayer structures of lanthanide complexes and their mixture with guest molecules, obtained by Langmuir–Blodgett technology, is investigated with using of π–A isotherms, X-ray and electron diffraction. Obtained results are interpreted in terms of macroscopic biaxial textures, which can be prepared in presence of magnetic field, including in a way some kind of guest–host effect."

"Charge-transfer (CT) interactions of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films with non-centrosymmetrical structure were examined from the viewpoint of nonlinear optics. Five kinds of LB films of CT complexes were prepared using TTF-based electron donors and acceptors of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and p-benzoquinone derivatives. The difference of the dipole moments between ground and excited states of these LB films was evaluated from the measurements of electroabsorption spectra."
"In this paper we present results concerning the development of a lithographic technique suitable for application to Langmuir–Blodgett films. Controlled ablations of well-defined portions of the film have been made by using a scanning force microscope (SFM). We report the values of the microscope operational parameters that have allowed us either to perform non-destructive imaging or to obtain reproducible ablations of controlled depth. In particular, our analysis has pointed out the importance of the scanning speed in giving rise to such surface modifications. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"A metal-overlayer infrared ATR technique proposed by Ishino and Ishida is one of the infrared reflection spectroscopies comprising the Ge prism/thin film/metal overlayer sample system and is expected to be a powerful tool for studying ultrathin organic films because of its high sensitivity. Since, in this case, the surface selection rule is valid, as in the case of conventional infrared reflection-absorption (RA) spectroscopy, it is also useful in providing information on the molecular structure and orientation in the films. Using this technique, Ishino and Ishida succeeded in obtaining high-quality infrared spectra of a thin (10-nm thick) cast film of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) as well as a two-monolayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of cadmium arachidate directly deposited on a Ge prism, followed by a vacuum evaporation of a silver overlayer (20-nm thick) on the sample films. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio thus obtained was estimated to be five times better than that achieved by RA spectroscopy."
"Abstract The problem of photosynthetic reaction centers has been a subject of intensive study during recent years. The interest in this subject is due to the high quantum and energetic efficiency of transforming light energy into the electrochemical potential. Up until now, grown crystals, suitable for structural investigation, provided information for only a few types of reaction centers. The reaction centers of multiheme cytochrome C complex from Rhodopseudomonas viridis 1,2 and Rhodobacter sphaeroidas R-263,4 are the most convenient for study."
"C60 forms very rigid insoluble films at the air-water interface (collapse pressure Πc=62.5 mN/m). The “area per molecule” Ao=21.6 Å2 (at Πc) are smaller than that of a single C60 molecule, and suggest 4 to 7.5 C60 molecules piled atop each other, per “monolayer”. C60 can be transferred as Langmuir-Blodgett films on glass and HOPG, and Langmuir-Schaefer films on a Cu grid. By ellipsometry of an LB multilayer, the thickness is about 2 molecules per “monolayer”. STM shows a slightly distorted {013} projection of an face-centered cubic (FCC) pattern of roundish, atomically unresolved peaks, with a cell constant of 14.2 Å. The HRTEM micrographs and a selected-area electron diffraction pattern show that, at optimum crystallinity, the C60 molecules pack in an FCC pattern with a=14.20(5) Å. No hexagonal structures were found."
"The amphiphilic complex bis[2–(N–hexadecylcarbamoyl–8–hydroxyquinoline]magnesium (MgL2) forms stable monolayer on pure water subphase and can be easily fabricated as stable uniform Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films. Low-angle X-ray diffraction measurements showed MgL2 LB films had good homogeneity with a bilayer thickness of ca. 4.92 nm. Anisotropy of conductivity was observed in the LB film. The in-plane conductivity parallel to the compression direction on quartz substrate and the vertical conductivity on ITO glass is found to be 4.50×10−5 and 2.44×10−9 S/m, respectively. Organic electroluminescent devices with a single layer structure (ITO/emitting layer (LB films)/Al) were constructed using MgL2 LB films as the emitting material. The number of the layer of LB films and the deposited surface pressure had strong influence on the EL intensity and break-down voltage of the EL devices."
"The 1-aza-15-crown 5-ether functional group can be incorporated into polymer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films as a comonomer of N-dodecylacrylamide. The surface pressure-area isotherms of the copolymers indicated the formation of the stable condensed monolayers on the air-water interface. The copolymer monolayers could be transferred onto solid substrates by the LB technique (Y-type deposition). The result of voltammetric measurement indicated that the functionalized electrodes covered with copolymer monolayers could collect the Ag+ by soaking them in the AgNO3 aqueous solution."

"This paper summarizes the cycle of authors’ studies devoted to polyamic acid-based Langmuir–Blodgett (LBF) functionalized by organic dyes. Previously reported results are supplemented with new experimental data. The monolayers of the polyamic acid under study, poly(4, 4'-diphenyl oxide)-2-carboxyisophthalamide, on water surface, which contains 110 –5 М Pb 2+ , at pH 5.8–6.0 the limiting area per repeating unit is S m = (0.52±0.02) nm 2 . The character of the compressing isotherms depends on the pH of the subphase because of the presence of the carboxylic group in the polymer unit. The monolayers and corresponding LBF obtained by the Schaefer method on solid support were modified via n-octadecyl alcohol, N-n-octadecylpyridinium bromide, and acid-base indicators and luminophores. For this purpose, n-decyl esters of fluorescein and eosin, rose Bengal B, n-heptadecyl ester of rhodamine B, N,N'-di-n-octadecylrhodamine, bromothymol blue, quinaldine red, and duplex quinaldine red are used. As a rule, the LBF contained 30–60 monolayers and 2 to 23 molar percent of dyes. The character of the emission and absorption spectra of rhodamine and hydroxyxanthene compounds in the mixed LBF as well as in multilayers of N-n-octadecylpyridinium bromide and stearic acid indicates the weakening of the dye dimerization and further aggregation of these dyes by the matrix. The procedure of determination of the apparent ionization constants of the dyes, pK a app , consisted in immersing of the LBF during 1–5 min into the aqueous solutions with different pH, air drying during several min, and measuring the absorption spectra. Experiments are performed as a rule at ionic strength of the subphase 0.05 М maintained by NaCl additives and 20 °С. Analysis of thus obtained pK a app (≡ – lgK a app ) values allows concluding that they are in outline close to the corresponding values obtained in micellar solutions of surfactants. These pK a app values may be divided into three groups. In the LBF consisting of entire N-n-octadecylpyridinium bromide, without polyamic acid, the pK a app values are generally close to those obtained for the same indicators in micelles of cationic surfactants and in droplets of cationic N-cetylpyridinium chloride-based microemulsions. An expressed differentiating action of this kind of BLF pseudophase is observed. The value of the electrostatic potential in the indicator locus is estimated as + 107 mV. The second group is represented by the pK a app values of indicators in polyamic acid-based LBF modified either by N-n-octadecylpyridinium bromide or n-octadecyl alcohol in the acidic region of pH. Under these conditions, the COOH groups of the polyamic acid are non-ionized, and the pK a app values are also close to those in cationic surfactant micelles. Finally, the third group of pK a app values corresponds to the pH region of 4–10. Here, the ionization of carboxylic groups of polyamic acid takes place. As a result, the transition range of indicators is anomalously expanded. It is these indicator equilibria that can be used in pH-sensor devices. The obtained results are compared with those reported by other authors. In addition, the peculiarity of dissociation of four-charged and triple-charged cations of the duplex quinaldine red is considered and compared with the dissociation of double-charged quinaldine red."
"Fourier transform transmission infrared and UV–Vis absorption spectra have been measured for a photochromic behavior of a novel amphiphile 2,4-dihydroxy-N-octadecylbenzylideneamine bearing Schiff base moiety as polar head in the close-packing LB films on solid supports. Measurement of π-A isotherm show that 2,4-dihydroxy-N-octadecylbenzylideneamine formed a stable and condensed monolayer at air–water interface. The built-up multilayer was found to exhibit photochromic behavior upon irradiation of 365 nm light. The configuration rearrangement of the π-electrons induced a large spectral change."
"The absorption and emission electronic spectra, and the fundamental vibrational frequencies of N-butyl-N'-R-3,4:9,10-perylenebis(dicarboximide) [R = H3(BPTCDM), 2H5(BPTCDE), 3H7(BPTCDPr), (CH3)3(BPTCDI) and 5H11(BPTCDP)] are discussed. The π-A isotherms for Langmuir layers were obtained and limiting areas are given. Langmuir—Blodgett (LB) films of these dye materials were deposited on glass, AgCl and Ag surfaces. Vibrational frequencies from LB films on metal surfaces were observed using surface enhanced resonance Raman Scattering (SERRS), reflection—absorption FTIR spectroscopy (RAIRS). Transmission FTIR spectra of KBr pellets and LB films on AgCl were obtained. The average molecular orientation in LB films was calculated from the transmission and RAIRS data for LB films. The formation of aggregates in the ground and excited state (excimer formation) and the effect of NO2 and NH3 gases on the fluorescence signal was also examined."
"The photoacoustic (PA) angular spectrum method was developed on the basis of attenuated total reflection (ATR) and PA spectroscopies. This method was used to obtain the resonance absorption spectrum of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films on silicon substrates. The rigorous electromagnetic theory in a layered medium is also presented to explain the experimental results and to characterize the films. By fitting theoretical results to the experimental spectrum, the refractice indices and the thickness of the films can be evaluated. Moreover, as the intensity of the laser beam increased, additional peaks were observed in the angular PA spectrum, predicted to be related to the optical non-linearity of LB films. Compared with conventional ATR spectroscopy, PA ATR spectroscopy has the advantages of a simpler optical system and higher sensitivity, as well as a wider application range."
"A pure Y-type transfer form for cadmium stearate (CdSt2) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films was obtained on a subphase of which the pH is suitable (6.4) as a result of using a higher surface pressure. The pressure dependence of the structure of the CdS produced within the LB matrix was observed. Monolayers of CdS were prepared by the exposure of CdSt2 LB films deposited under higher surface pressure (37.5 mN/m) to H2S gas at a pressure of 0.25 Torr. If the LB films deposited under lower surface pressure were used as the matrix, CdS would aggregate to the particles within the stearic acid (SA) LB films. And these phenomena suggest a novel means to control the microstructure of aggregates formed. We suggested that it should be ascribed to the larger interaction between the hydrocarbon chains of the LB films in the case of the higher surface pressure. This larger interaction can offer a sufficient position control for the guest sulphide monolayer. At the same time, the reaction speed of the LB films with the H2S gas, as well as the form speed of CdS, was dependent on the layer number of the LB films and the surface pressure under which the LB films were deposited."

"The presence of a monolayer of ω-(2-anthryl)-alkanoic acid on an anthracene or perylene single crystal modifies the kinetics of photosensitized hole injection. An increase in the chain length of the ω-(2-anthryl)-alkanoic acid leads to a decrease in the quantum yield of the sensitized hole current (SHC). This effect becomes more important when the ionization potential of the dye is decreased. This argument supports the hypothesis that electron transfer is assisted by an interaction between the HOMO of the dye and that of the alkyl chain. The permanent electric field existing at the interface between the monolayer of ω-(2-anthryl)-alkanoic acid and the monolayer containing the dye is also expected to influence the free energy gain associated with this electron transfer process. When the dye is diluted by tripalmitine instead of arachidic acid, the change in the electrical potential difference at the interface with the monolayer of ω-(2-anthryl)-alkanoic acid leads to a tenfold decrease in the quantum yield of the SHC."
"Two iron complexes of a porphyrin dimer molecule were synthesized and studied at the air-water interface and in Langumir-Blodgett (LB) films. Surface pressure-area isotherm and UV-vis absorption spectroscopic studies revealed an interesting molecular switching behavior between the two iron porphyrin complexes under basic or acidic conditions. Such a reversible structural transition does not only occur in solution phase, but readily takes place in the deposited Langmuir-Blodgett films. Domains with strip or disk-like shapes were formed in the Langmuir films of the metalloporphyrin complexes when barbituric acid was added into the subphase, an indication of supramolecular network formation between the metalloporphyrin dimer and barbituric acid molecules. Magnetic property studies of the Langmuir-Blodgett films of the iron porphyrin complexes by magnetic force microscopy provide further insights into relationships between the magnetic response and molecular structures of the metalloporphyrin LB films."
"Langmuir films of the title compound have been spread on an aqueous subphase at various values of pH at 10, 15 and 20°C. Increasing pH and increasing temperature favour stable films, but at the higher subphase pH and temperature values the pressure–area isotherms exhibit a transition to aggregated forms. Tilt angles between the alkyl chains and the normal to the subphase increase with increasing subphase pH and temperature. The area per molecule for films deposited at 15 °C decreased steadily with time at a fixed surface pressure, except at the highest pH, indicating poor stability. Langmuir–Blodgett films deposited at a surface pressure of 30 mN m−1 and a subphase temperature of 15 °C were of Y-type and showed transfer ratios above unity for the lower subphase pH values. UV/visible spectra of the LB films showed features characteristic of the formation of H aggregates for deposition at the higher subphase pH values. Over long periods of time the spectra for high pH showed evidence of increasing aggregation. Small-angle X-ray diffraction confirmed molecular tilts larger than those deduced in the floating monolayer. Reflection–absorption infrared spectroscopy of the LB films showed differences from the bulk also indicative of significant tilt, as did surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The LB films showed weak second-harmonic generation from 1064 nm radiation consistent with a polar film structure parallel to the substrate. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

"We fabricated junctions with a polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film, and then examined electron tunneling through PI LB films. It was concluded that PI LB films function as good electrical tunneling barriers for inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). We also fabricated junctions with a PI LB film containing porphyrin (PORPI), and then examined the electron transport properties of the junctions by means of IETS measurement. An inelastic tunneling process accompanying by the energy loss due to either the excitation of vibrational modes of porphyrin or the excitation of electronic transitions in porphyrin was observed."
"Methodologies for the in situ generation of size-quantized semiconductor particulate films (SQSPFs) are described. Cadmium and zinc sulfides have been generated from their divalent metal ion precursors electrostatically attached to well-compressed, negatively charged monolayers by the infusion of hydrogen sulfide. SQSPFs have been characterized by spectrophotometry, electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical measurements. Evidence is presented for the oriented growth and preparation-dependent rectification behavior of SQSPFs"
"Abstract The “in-plane anisotropy” of a triphenylene derivative in Langmuir-Blodgett (L.B.) films has been investigated. Upon heating, L.B. films exhibit a reversible phase transition appearing as an abrupt increase from a low to a high “in-plane anisotropy” corresponding to the formation of the same hexagonal liquid crystal phase observed in the bulk material at almost the same temperature, with the columnar axis aligned along the dipping direction."

"The electronic absorption spectra of pure Langmuir (L) films of 6MeDS prepared upon MgCl2, CaCl2, CdCl2, and CuCl2 aqueous solutions have shown that the Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+ cations promote the J-aggregation of the dye, but the Cu2+ cation inhibits it. Instead, the Cu2+ cation promotes the formation of another type of dye aggregate (D-aggregate), which exhibits a split electronic absorption band. These L films have been transferred onto solid substrates by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. The vibronic absorption spectra observed for the obtained LB films have shown the similarity between the metal–cation-containing J-aggregate and the metal-free J-aggregate of the dye, the latter of which was characterized in the previous study [K. Ikegami, J. Chem. Phys. 121 (2004) 2337]. These spectra have also indicated that the bimolecular metal chelation plays an important role in the J-aggregation, like the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the metal-free case."
"Arachidic acid (C20) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films with cyanine (Cy) dyes were fabricated by the diffusion–adsorption LB method with applying bias voltages Vd, and the structures and the electrical properties were investigated. From the absorption spectra, the amount and the orientation of the Cy dyes and the formation of the aggregates in the LB films were found to be controlled by Vd. The electrical properties were investigated from conduction current and thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements. The current–voltage characteristics and transient current properties showed the ionic hopping conduction. From the transient current properties, the sample deposited under negative Vd seemed to include larger amounts of mobile ions and the mobile ions were supposed to be positive. The TSCs were also due to the ionic space charge polarization. The results in this work will be useful for the control of electrical properties in LB film devices."
"Fabrication of efficient SERS active substrates from the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of Calf Thymus-DNA (CT-DNA) molecule after incubation into gold nanocolloid for 24 h has been presented. Relaxation kinetics of CT-DNA molecules at the air-water interface has been explicitly studied. The experimental observations from UV–Vis electronic absorption spectra together with the FESEM and AFM images of CT-DNA molecule organized in LB film collectively suggest the presence of H-type aggregated domains due to plane-to-plane self-association of the CT-DNA molecules on the surface of the LB film. XPS spectrum of the as prepared substrate has been unveiled to identify its chemical compositions while their morphological features are explored from the FESEM and AFM images. The SERS efficacy of the substrate has been tested with the 4-Mercaptopyridine (4-MPy) molecule at trace concentration. SERS enhancement factors ranging from 106–107 orders of magnitude have been evaluated for the characteristic bands of the 4-MPy molecule. The substrate not only exhibits appreciable spectral reproducibility, but it also confirms its stability and uniformity. The as prepared SERS active substrate has also been used for thiram detection at ultrasensitive concentration."

"The phase transition of the headgroup in a Langmuir−Blodgett film fabricated with bipyridinum bis-(tetracyanoquinodimethane anion radical) salts attached with long chain alkyl groups has been studied using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The C18 double chain attached more efficiently to the dipyridinium stabilized the alkyl chain and headgroup structure than the C22 single chain. The stability of the film may be due to the size matching between headgroup and hydrocarbon. The headgroup melting temperature of the double chain compound was 367 K and that of the single chain compound was 347 K, which was identified by ESR spectroscopy. A pretransition between two gel states was found. The viscosity estimated with the rotational correlation time of electron spin resonance spectroscopy was 0.8 poise for the Langmuir−Blodgett films."
"Fullerene C60 and a succinic acid derivative have been deposited on glass slides and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets by the Langmuir-Blodgett method starting from Langmuir layers at the water/air interface at different compression states. This method leads to important modifications of the wetting properties of both solid surfaces, which can be discussed in terms of degree and quality of coverage of the solid substrates. Hence, the possibility of obtaining actual monomolecular layers of fullerenes either on water or on solid substrates via chemical modifications by hydrophobic substituents on C60 are discussed. The structures of these films are discussed by measuring their absorption at 450 nm and their wetting properties."

"An investigation of nuclear spin lattice relaxation was performed on a conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film based on a charge-transfer (CT) complex of bisethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene (BO) and decyltetracyanoquinodimethane $({\mathrm{C}}_{10}\mathrm{TCNQ}).$ The characteristic peak of the relaxation rate ${T}_{1}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ of ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}$ was observed at a low temperature (10 K). As in its pristine solid $(\mathrm{BO}\ensuremath{-}{\mathrm{C}}_{10}\mathrm{TCNQ}$ complex), the behavior of the relaxation rate was explained by the theory of localization. From the quantitative analysis of the behavior, the detailed dynamics of the localized electrons in the LB film were successfully obtained. In addition, the outer-planar anisotropy of ${T}_{1}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ of ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}$ was observed in the LB film. This indicates that the observed echo mainly originated from ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}$ at the end ethylene groups of BO. The fact that the field dependence of this anisotropic ${T}_{1}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ is well fitted by the cosine curve provides detailed information of the hyperfine structures in the LB film. Considering these results in combination with those of the temperature dependence of ${T}_{1}^{\ensuremath{-}1},$ it is concluded that the variance of each level of BO is small and that the nature of disorder in the LB film is that of a continuum."
"Direct current (d.c.) electrical properties of bis(4-diethyannodithiobenzil)nickel and stearyl alcohol mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films (BDN-SA LB films) were measured using multilayer LB films deposited on planar interdigital electrodes under various pressure and temperature conditions. The results show that the conductivity of the LB films is strongly influenced by the pressure and temperature. The activation energy is estimated to be approximately 0.56 eV, close to the 0.50 eV value of the bulk material. The correlation between the electrical conductivity of the LB films with atmosphere pressure is discussed."
"A series of copolyimide Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films with different chemical structure was fabricated into xerographic photoreceptors and its electrophotographic properties were measured by photoinduced discharge method. Comparison was made between the LB films and the corresponding 1 μm solvent-cast films. It was found that the copolyimide LB films have the advantage of high electrophotographic performance. The results could be ascribed to charge-transfer complexes formation, nanometer film thickness, compact molecular packing and chain alignment in the copolyimide LB films."
"Preliminary experiments are described here to high light the possibility of controlling the structural orientation of conducting nanomaterials by the LB technique and the impact on the physical properties."
"Langmuir-Blodgettfilms of poly(acrylonitrile-co-4-vinylpyridine) were assembled on quartz and calcium fluoride substrates from a preformed monolayer on water. The observed transfer ratios indicated z-type deposition. Infrared spectroscopic measurements in the transmission mode revealed a linear dependence of the nitrile absorbance as a function of the number of layers deposited. Polarized infrared spectroscopy was used to semiquantitatively determine the average chain orientation in the film. Calculations of dichroic ratios indicate that the chains lie relatively flat on the substrate surface. Polarized ultraviolet spectroscopy was also utilized to determine the orientation of the pyridine headgroups in the LB film, and the calculations indicated a pyridine tilt angle of approximately 19 degrees to the film surface.

"Abstract Long chain perfluoroalkyl groups were introduced to polyamine derivatives which had different chain length and Langmuir–Blodgett films of these amphiphiles were prepared. When pentaethylenehexamine was used as polyamine derivative, stable surface monolayers were formed and properties of the LB films were similar to the polymer LB films, however, less stable surface monolayer was formed as chain length became shorter."
"In a series of our recent studies, the simulation of the light harvesting and the succeeding charge separation processes with Langmuir-Blodgett films were examined. These molecular devices can be used for photo-electric conversion and are called molecular photodiodes. The size of the molecular devices is, however, molecular only in the thickness, where the lateral dimension is macroscopic. Phase separation phenomena in mixed monolayers of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon amphiphiles were studied with various scanning probe microscopes (SPM). We propose that such a phase separation can be used as one method to decrease the size of these molecular devices as well as micro processing by SPM."

The noise power is three orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by Hooge's formula. A theoretical model for the origin of $1/f$ noise due to fluctuations of the number of charge propagation paths in the sample is proposed. The calculations of $1/f$ noise level using this model are in quantitative agreement with experimental results not only in the LB films but also in tetrathiofulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) crystals."
"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films formed of some discotic liquid crystals, namely 3,4,9,10-tetra-(<i>n</i>-alkoxy-carbonyl)- perylenes, have been studied. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded. The results obtained have led to conclusions about formation of dimers both in ground and excited states at the air-solid substrate interface. Moreover, information about the molecular arrangement in LB films has been obtained."
"The orientational changes in optical nonlinear active side chains of polyamic acid alkyl amine salt monolayers before and after the imidization process were studied by optical surface second-harmonic generation (SHG). The polymeric Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) monolayer composed of the triphenylamino-( p -nitrophenyl)-ethylene group as a side chain of polyamic acid was prepared by the precursor method. The analysis of the experimental results showed that the symmetry of the side chain unit in the monolayer remains C ∞ v after imidization process. Moreover, the side chain molecular orientational distribution functions (ODFs) of the polymeric monolayer before and after imidization were obtained using the modified maximum entropy method. From the obtained ODFs, it was found that the polar angle of the side chain increases by imidization and this causes the decrement of the nonlinear optical components. However the half-width (Δθ) of the major molecular tilt angle decreases by imidization, suggesting that the distribution of the chromophore is more uniformly packed through the imidization process."

"Attenuated total reflection (ATR) properties, scattered light and emission due to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation from Ag film and merocyanine (MC) LB film on Ag film were investigated. A Kretschmann configuration of the ATR measurement, prism/Ag film/air or prism/Ag film/MC LB film/air structures were used for the SPP excitation. The thicknesses and the dielectric constants of the Ag and the MC LB films were obtained from the ATR measurement. Scattered lights due to the SPP excitation were also observed from the Ag thin film and the MC LB film in the ATR measurement. Furthermore, emission was observed through the prism when a laser beam was irradiated to the sample from the air. The angles of the emission peaks almost corresponded to the resonant angles of the ATR curves. It was considered that the emission was due to the SPP excitation and depended on the surface roughness of the films. The intensities of the emission from the Ag film strongly depended on the incident angle of the laser beam."
"The photovoltaic characteristics of A1/44 monolayers of Chl b/Ag sandwich cells are reported. Open-circuit photovoltages as high as 1.1 V were observed for most photovoltaic cells. The variation of the shortcircuit photocurrent with light intensity is shown to be strongly dependent upon the wavelength of illumination. The low fill factor values of the Chl b cells (0.15–0.19) are related to the large internal resistance of the devices, which is mainly caused by the insulating layer present at the aluminium/pigment junction. The short-circuit photocurrent is found to increase exponentially with temperature. An activation energy of 0.19 eV was determined at the maximum absorption in the red region."
"We investigated the effects of deposition parameters, subphase additions and annealing on the optical linear (absorption) and nonlinear (second harmonic generation) properties of hemicyanine (HEM) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films via aggregate status variations. HEM molecules formed H- aggregates in LB films, characterized by a blue-shift of the absorption band relative to the monomeric spectra, leading to a reduction of the effective hyperpolarizability beta due to the second harmonic off-resonant effect. The spontaneous aggregation mainly occurred during compression on the Langmuir trough. The degree of H-aggregate could be reduced and beta could be enhanced by raising the compressional speed and/or lowering the deposition surface pressure. By adding KI in the subphase, the observed beta-enhancement and absorption band red-shift in HEM LB monolayers were attributed to H-aggregate dissociation and intramolecular charge transfer. The time-resolved fluorescence profiles of HEM LB multilayers showed that there mainly existed two species (monomer and dimer) with characteristic decay times in the order of 100 ps and 10 ps, respectively."

"We study the preparation and capping of silver nanoparticles by several unsaturated long-chain carboxylates. UV−visible and FTIR spectroscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy are used to characterize the effect of the chain length, its configuration, and the degree of unsaturation on the size distribution of the nanoparticles. Langmuir layers and Langmuir−Blodgett films are used to study the adsorption of these carboxylates on the particles. We find that unsaturated carboxylates in the cis configuration are useful stabilizers for the control of particle size and its surface properties."

"We discuss the results of scanning probe microscopy studies of the surface morphology of ordered molecular films from organic low-molecular-mass and polymeric compounds. Films considered include: self-assembled monolayers, Langmuir-Blodgett films and composite molecular films fabricated from different organic compounds. Several aspects of these systems are revealed: their nanoscale surface morphology, typical naturally occurring defects of the surfaces and molecular-scale ordering. Surface modification of soft organic materials during scanning with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip is considered as well. For various classes of ordered molecular films, application of the AFM technique and other scanning probe techniques such as lateral force microscopy produce a new level of in situ quantitative characterization of molecular films on micrometre, submicrometre and molecular scales."
"The deposition and characterization of Langmuir-Blodgett films containing the organic semiconductor perylene are described. By itself, perylene was found not to form good Langmuir-Blodgett films; however, when mixed with a fatty acid it was possible to build up high quality multilayers. These have been investigated using a number of techniques, including absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance and ellipsometry."
"Photochromism has been studied for two comb-like liquid-crystalline copolymers (I) and (II) containing azobenzene chromophores in their side chains. In a smectic glass phase of both copolymers, upon short-time irradiation by UV light, long-living cis isomers are observed. Both copolymers manifest the photoinduced anisotropy, the physical mechanisms of which seem to be quite different. In spin-coated films of polymer (II), the origin of the anisotropy is a strong stable dichroism, which is due to an enrichment and depletion of the chosen angular direction, correspondingly, with trans and cis isomers of the azobenzene chromophores. Polymer (I) manifests no dichroism at all, and its induced optical anisotropy may be accounted for by a rather slow chromophore reorientation. In copolymer (II) a considerable reorientation of the mesogenic groups also occurs as a secondary phenomenon at the stage of the cis isomer formation only. This observation shed more light on the general process of the light-induced molecular reorientation in polymers, liquid crystals, and Langmuir–Blodgett films, which is of great importance for holographic information recording."

"Abstract The design and synthesis of Aviram–Ratner‐type molecular rectifiers, featuring an anilino‐substituted extended tetracyanoquinodimethane (exTCNQ) acceptor, covalently linked by the σ‐spacer bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) to a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) donor moiety, are described. The rigid BCO spacer keeps the TTF donor and exTCNQ acceptor moieties apart, as demonstrated by X‐ray analysis. The photophysical properties of the TTF‐BCO‐exTCNQ dyads were investigated by UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, and theoretical calculations. Langmuir–Blodgett films were prepared and used in the fabrication and electrical studies of junction devices. One dyad showed the asymmetric current–voltage ( I–V ) curve characteristic for rectification, unlike control compounds containing the TTF unit but not the exTCNQ moiety or comprising the exTCNQ acceptor moiety but lacking the donor TTF part, which both gave symmetric I–V curves. The direction of the observed rectification indicated that the preferred electron current flows from the exTCNQ acceptor to the TTF donor."

"Time and frequency domain sum-frequency generation (SFG) were combined to study the dynamics and structure of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a fused silica surface. SFG-free induction decay (SFG-FID) of octadecylsilane SAM in the CH stretching region shows a relatively long time scale oscillation that reveals that six vibrational modes are involved in the response of the system. Five of the modes have commonly been used for the fitting of SFG spectra in the CH stretching region, namely the symmetric stretch and Fermi resonance of the methyl group, the antisymmetric stretch of the methyl, as well as the symmetric and antisymmetric stretches of the methylene group. The assignment of the sixth mode to the terminal CH(2) group was confirmed by performing a density function theory calculation. The SFG-FID measures the vibrational dephasing time (T(2)) of each of the modes, including a specific CH(2) group within the SAM, the terminal CH(2), which had never been measured before. The relatively long (∼1.3 ps) dephasing of the terminal CH(2) suggests that alkyl monolayer structure is close to that of the liquid condensed phase of Langmuir Blodgett films."

"Alternate bilayer structures of N,N′-bis(2,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene dicarboximide (PDI), free-base phthalocyanines (Pc), and double-linked free-base phthalocyanine−fullerene dyad (Pc−C60) were prepared by the Langmuir−Schäfer method and studied using a range of optical spectroscopy methods including femtosecond pump−probe and up-conversion. An efficient quenching of the PDI fluorescence by Pc and Pc−C60 dyad was observed in both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The quenching takes place in less than a few picoseconds, and is due to energy transfer from perylene dicarboximide to phthalocyanine chromophore in PDI|Pc and PDI|Pc−C60 films. In the PDI|Pc−C60 bilayer structure the energy transfer is followed by a charge separation in the Pc−C60 layer, yielding a long-lived (a few microseconds) intermolecular charge separated state similar to that reported recently for Pc−C60 Langmuir−Blodgett films (Lehtivuori, H.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2008, 112, 9896−9902)."
"Nanometric electrostatic space charges exist at the metal/molecular film interface due to the displacement of excessive electrons from metal to molecular films. As a result, surface potential is built across the films on metal. The distributions of the displaced electrons and the electronic density of states in films can be determined using the surface potential built. The current–voltage characteristic of tunneling device using polyimide Langmuir–Blodgett films is discussed with taking into account the space charge."

"The stabilization of a bivalent oxidation state in cobalt complexes of phenolate-based asymmetric tridentate ligands with iodo and bromo substituents is studied. The complexes [CoII(LIA)2].2CH3OH (1) and [CoII(LBrA)2].CH3OH (2) were characterized by means of several spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques. The molecular structure of 1 was determined by diffractometric analysis and reveals the cobalt(II) ion in a distorted-octahedral geometry. The centrosymmetric metal ion adopts a local D2h symmetry and is surrounded by facially coordinated ligands. Equivalent donor sets in both ligands are trans to each other, and DFT calculations suggest that the fac-trans configuration is favored by a small margin when compared to the fac-cis isomers. Both DFT calculations and EPR spectroscopy agree with a high-spin S=3/2 electronic configuration given by [ag1, b1g1, ag1, b2g2, b3g2]. This oxidation state was indirectly observed by the lack of a ppiphenolate-->dsigma*cobalt(III) charge-transfer band, which is found between 430 and 470 nm for similar cobalt(III) species. On the basis of the geometrical preferences and the oxidation state of archetypical 1 and 2, two metallosurfactants [CoII(LI-ODA)2] (3) and [CoII(LI-NOBA)2].CH2Cl2 (4) were obtained. The redox chemistry of 1-4 is marked by metal- and ligand-centered activity with several follow up processes and film formation on the electrode. Both metallosurfactants exhibit amphiphilic properties and organization, as shown by compression isotherms and Brewster angle microscopy but exhibit dissimilar collapse mechanisms; whereas 3 collapses at constant pressure, 4 exhibits a constant-area collapse. Langmuir-Blodgett films are readily obtained and were characterized by equilibrium contact angle and atomic force microscopy."

"The molecular arrangement induced in Langmuir-Blodgett films of a disc-like mesogene is studied by means of various structural and optical methods. The disc-like molecules show an “edge-on” arrangement with a bilayer periodicity normal to the solid substrate and a nematic arrangement in the monolayers planes."
"We report an observation of optical phase conjugate and high-order diffractions from degenerate multi-wave mixing in LB films of pure purple membrane for the first time. Based on the simplified BR photocycle, a model that describes the high-order diffractions from the population gratings versus the total incident intensity has been developed. The saturated absorption intensity and the saturated nonlinear refractive index of the LB films have been estimated by fitting method to be 0.42 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, and 5 X 10<SUP>-2</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP>W, respectively. The typical response time of its nonlinearity is about several milliseconds."
"The aggregation and spectral properties of three sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine compounds in chloroform solution and LB films were investigated by using UV-Vis absorption spectra. The experimental results indicated that the three sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine molecules formed H-aggregates in the chloroform solution, but the absorption spectra of the three sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine compounds display strong absorption peaks of monomer when the concentration of the sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine solutions was 10(-7) mol x L(-1). The addition of substitutent --OC8H17 not only decreased the aggregation behaviors of the sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine, but also leaded to red-shift of the absorption peaks, and it had a biggish influence on the intensity of absorption spectra. The absorption Soret bands were splitting when the substitutent --OC8H17 was added. The substitutent --OC8H17 had a strong effect on the existence state of bisphthalocyaines in LB films, while TmPc2 and TmPcPc* molecules formed H-aggregates in LB films, however TmPc2* molecule formed T-aggregates. In the LB films, the distance between sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine molecule was shortened, and the interaction of molecules was enhanced, therefore the absorption peaks were red-shifted compared with those in the solution, and the arranging state of sandwich thulium bisphthalocyanine molecule has biggish influence on the peaks of absorption spectra."
"The N=N bridge in azobenzenes molecules with push-pull structures at the two ends provides excellent channels for electrons.This is an advantage for generation of nonlinear optics effect.And the nonlinear optical properties of the azobenzene compounds are greatly affected by the push-pull electronic groups.The spectra and nonlinear optical properties of Langmuir-Blodgett(LB) films of two kinds of push-pull azobenzene compounds were investigated by using ultraviolet(UV)-visible absorption spectra and second harmonic generation(SHG) technique.The steady mono-molecular film could be formed at the interface of air/water and transferred well onto solid substrates,forming high-quality LB multilayer films for the 4-(nitro)-4′-(amido)-azobenzene(NAA) and 4-(carboxylic)-4′-(amidogen)-azobenzene(CAA) molecules.Because the-NO2 has a stronger ability on pulling electron than-COOH,the transfer of the intra-molecular electron is easier and could form bigger molecular dipole for NAA than that for CAA.So it could have a more significant second-order nonlinear hyperpolarizability.The second-order nonlinear optical coefficient d33 of experimental measurement for NAA and CAA in LB films were 40.8 pm/V and 24.2 pm/V,and the hyperpolarizabilities β were 1.97×10-29 esu and 1.17×10-29 esu respectively.The hyperpolarizabilities β of NAA molecule was about 1.7 times bigger than CAA molecule′s.The experimental results agreed well with the theoretical calculation."
"Bonding of silicon wafers is required in microelectronics fabrication, for example. A room‐temperature bonding process that leads to sufficient bond strength is necessary for bonding semi‐processed wafers, i.e., those already containing temperature‐sensitive structures. The room‐temperature bonding of hydrophobic wafers is reported for the first time, an ultra‐tin Langmuir‐Blodgett film of a “hairy” rod‐like polymer being used as an intermediate layer. The effect of the polymer layer on the surface roughness is investigated and possible directions o future work are indicated."

"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of Eu(dpm)3 (dpm=2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) and Gd(dpm)3 coexisting with arachidic acid (AA) (complexes: AA=1:2, in molar ratio) with different molar percentages were prepared. Luminescence enhancement of Gd(dpm)3 on Eu(dpm)3 in the mixed films was studied in detail. The mixed monolayers of Eu(dpm)3/Gd(dpm)3/AA with different molar proportions at air–water interface were studied by π–A isotherms behaviors. The mixed LB films were characterized by means of low angle X-ray diffraction (LAXRD), UV-visible absorption spectra and photo-induced emission spectra. The possible structure of its resulting LB film was proposed. The results of UV-visible absorption spectra indicated that the complexes of rare earth-β-diketonate were homogeneously transferred onto the substrates layer-by-layer. The results of luminescence spectra also indicated that Gd(dpm)3 and Y(dpm)3 had a luminescence enhancement effect on Eu(dpm)3 in the mixed LB films, while Gd(dpm)3 had a stronger luminescence enhancement effect."
"Substitution reactions of TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) with suitable electron donor moieties extended the range of gamma-bridged adducts R(4)Q3CNQ and R(4)P3CNQ of which the short chain Z-beta-(l-butyl-4'-quinolinium)-alpha-cyano-4-styryldicyanomethanide (C[4]H[9](4)Q3CNQ) is a typical example. These zwitterionic D-pi-A materials (where D and A are electron donors and acceptors respectively) exhibit properties such as solvatochromism, molecular rectification and second harmonic generation. Further synthetic work concentrated on modifying the donor, the acceptor and the substitution position within these zwitterions to create a series of diverse materials for non-linear optic research. Modification of the picolinium and quinolinium systems where the TCNQ substitution is in the alpha-position, has created the extensive analogous series-R(2)Q3CNQ and R(2)P3CNQ, their properties being compared and contrasted to the original gamma-bridged adducts. The behaviour of the materials on the subphase and their resultant Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film fabrication was studied. The abrupt change in molecular orientation in LB films of the gamma-bridged adducts occurring at R= C[15]H[31] and above was not seen in the more flatly orientated alpha-bridged adducts. Further characterisation of the LB films was performed using reflectance-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).A number of N-alkylpyridinium benzimidazolate betaine derivatives and the related betaine-TCNQ adducts were prepared and their LB film forming properties were studied."
"The Langmuir-Blodgett film and the second-order nonlinear optical properties of a new azo compound were investigated by using means of second harmonic generation(SHG) and UV-visible absorption spectra.Stable monolayer of 4-(carboxylic)-4'-(amidogen)-azo benzene molecular could be formed on sub-phase surface.It could be transferred to solid substrate and deposited LB multilayers. The dependence of SHG intensity on the incident angle of fundamental beam was measured.The SHG signal intensity was very strong and it shows a maximum at about 60° in the monolayer.The hyperpolarizability β was about 1.17×10~-29esu."

"Persistent spectral hole-burning has recently been employed in investigations of pseudo-two-dimensional systems such as porphyrin and organic dye doped Langmuir-Blodgett films [1]. In order to perform spectral measurements on such ultra-thin materials, especially in the case of monolayers, the necessity to work with highly concentrated samples arises. For example, in a spectral hole-burning study of porphyrin centres in a multilayer assembly [2], the average distance between chromophores was about 3.5 nm which is of the same order as the Forster radius for energy transfer. Energy transfer and aggregation of impurities at high concentrations may strongly interfere with other processes under investigation such as optical dephasing and spectral diffusion. The effect of impurity concentration on spectral properties is an effective way of determining the dominant processes. Some data has already been published for conventional bulk systems such as tetracene doped alcohol glass [3] and chlorin and tetraphenylporphyrin doped polystyrene [4]. Here we present results of investigations of concentration effects on spectra and hole-burning of impurity doped Langmuir-Blodgett films."

"Dielectric fluorescent samples are imaged by scanning near-field optical microscopy in reflection. A non-metallized tapered fibre tip is used both as an emitter and a detector. Shear force feedback controls the distance between the tip and the sample and gives simultaneously a topographic image of the surface. A direct correlation with the optical image is obtained. We demonstrate that this reflection setup is suitable for dielectric samples. Images in fluorescence have been obtained on Langmuir-Blodgett films. For fluorescence detection the optical contrast is unambiguous, and consequently we estimate the detecting size of the probe at about 200 nm. Operation in reflection opens new possibilities since it allows the study of metallic, thick, opaque or dielectric sample and can be easily combined with a transmission setup. In this way, biological samples can be imaged optically simultaneously in transmission, reflection and with a shear force control."
"UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence, originating from the 2,5-distyrylpyrazine (DSP) chromophore incorporated into the polymer backbone of polyamic acid and polyimide were demonstrated in the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The formation of an aggregated structure with a large Stokes shift and a weak emissive intensity was observed in the cases of the polyamic acid 1 and the polyimide 3 LB films. In-plane anisotropic optical properties manifested by the polymer LB films indicated that the DSP chromophores were highly oriented parallel to the dipping direction. Meanwhile, photo-polymerization of the DSP chromophores was observed in the polyimide 3 LB film. This suggested that a three dimensional network structure was formed in the polymer LB film."

"The electrical properties of thermally stable multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polyimide (PI) were examined for cases of Al/PI/Al, Au/PI/Au and Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) junctions. The monolayer thickness of the multilayer PI LB films was about 0.4 nm, and Pb-Bi is a superconducting electrode. The authors also fabricated Nb/Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) Josephson junctions, and examined the electrical properties of the junctions at a temperature of 4.2 K. For Nb/Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) junctions, the typical I-V characteristic for a weakly coupled superconductor was seen. For Au/PI/Au junctions, it was concluded that PI LB layers become good electrically insulating barriers when the number of deposited layers is greater than about 30. For Al/PI/Al junctions, it is shown that an aluminum native oxide layer formed on the base Al electrode makes a significant contribution to the electrical conduction through the PI layer.< <ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">&gt;</ETX>"

"In this contribution several applications of infrared ellipsometry for studies in the mid infrared spectral range of polymeric and Langmuir–Blodgett films will be presented. For the quantitative evaluation iterative calculations based on an optical layer model are employed. Modelling of the measured ellipsometric spectra gives layer thickness and anisotropic optical constants. The optical constants can be interpreted in terms of molecular orientations and distortions of the molecular structure within a layer. Two different strategies for determination of the anisotropic optical constants of a uniaxial film are discussed. As outlook recent developments using synchrotron infrared ellipsometry opening new ways for investigations with submillimeter resolution in a reflection experiment with a defined angle of incidence are presented."
"New amphiphilic cyclodextrins are synthesized by selective modification. Two synthetic strategies are investigated. Per-(6-thio-2,3-trimethylsilyl)cyclodextrins can only be obtain by synthesizing first the per-6-thio-cyclodextrin and then silylating the remaining hydroxy functions. Characterizations of the products were achieved by ESI-MS and intramolecular coupling between thiol functions was evidenced. These new compounds are shown to be amphiphilic, and form stable Langmuir–Blodgett films that can be transferred on the upstroke and the downstroke of a substrate with a transfer ratio close to unity."

"A new class of dendritic amphiphiles with multi-hydrophilic head groups has been synthesized and characterized. The results from their surface pressure vs. area isotherms and hysteresis curves indicate that they form highly compressible and stable monolayers at the air-water interface. The topology of dendritic monolayer and Langmuir-Blodgett films was investigated by atomic force microscopy, which showed a highly ordered aggregation."
"A new nanometallic pattern, characterized by randomly disposed double or twin one-dimensional stripes and that adds to the nanotechnology toolbox, has been obtained from a unique template possessing the nanostrand morphology. This morphology had previously been shown to form in Langmuir-Blodgett films made from a polystyrene-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-P4VP) diblock copolymer blended with 3-n-pentadecylphenol (PDP). The nanostrand backbone is composed of PS, and it is bordered along both sides by a P4VP monolayer, visualized for the first time by high resolution atomic force microscopy. The exposed P4VP alongside the nanostrands serves as sites for depositing compounds attracted selectively to P4VP. Here, both gold ions (HAuCl4·3H2O) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP, 12 nm in diameter, stabilized with sodium citrate) were complexed to the P4VP. Plasma treatment of the gold ions led to double stripes of monolayer metallic gold. To obtain dense deposition of AuNP in double rows, it was necessary to acidify the AuNP aqueous solution (pH 5.2 here). The achievement of the metallic double-stripe patterns also confirms the composition of the nanostrand morphology, which up to now had been deduced indirectly. The double-stripe pattern has possible applications for plasmonic lasers, energy transport, and biosensors."
"SHG and THG signals were observed by reflection from the Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer of a Sec-butyl derivative of 4-methyl-6-nitro-2-quinolinamine. A floating monolayer was obtained by spreading chloroform solutions on ultrapure water and the subsequent evaporation of chloroform. The monolayer was deposited on a suitably treated glass slide at a compression rate of 100 cm 2 /min and a pressure of 12 mN/m. The 1064 nm fundamental wave emanating from a Nd:YAG laser was incident at a 45° angle on the monolayer surface, with the length of the substrate in a vertical plane. Signals were observed at 532 nm (SHG) and 355 nm (THG). When the sample was rotated by 90° in a vertical plane, the SHG signal vanished and the THG signal became much smaller. SHG and THG signals were also observed by reflection from a L-B film of 20 monolayers. When this sample was rotated by 90°, there was no significant difference in the intensity of the signals. The values of χ 2 and χ 3 were determined to be 10 −6 and 5 × 10 −4 esu, respectively, by using standard relations."
"Abstract Multicomponent Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films containing poly-pyrrole, 3-octadecanoyl pyrrole, and poly(3-hexylthiophene) were fabricated via a novel in-situ polymerization process. In this process, pyrrole monomer is polymerized at the air-subphase interface in the presence of poly(3-hexylthiophene) by using a subphase containing 1 wt% FeCl3. The resultant electrically conductive films could be readily deposited onto solid substrates as Z-type films by the vertical lifting method. By using visible absorption, x-ray diffraction, and FTIR measurements, it was found that all three components were present within the transferred films, with the polypyrrole chains assuming a preferential orientation parallel to the film surface. The conductivities of the mixed LB films were as high as 1.0 S/cm, and the stability of the conductivity was very good. Chemical doping of poly(3-hexylthiophene) within the film with strong oxidizing agents such as I2 further enhanced the conductivity of the film."
"Third-order nonlinear susceptibilities {chi}{sub xxxx}{sup (3)} (-3{omega}; {omega}, {omega}, {omega}) have been deduced by measuring third-harmonic generation in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of 1-benzyl-9-hydrofullerene-60 (C{sub 60}-Be). The structural features of the condensed layer at the air-water interface and LB films of the C{sub 60}-Be were investigated by small angle x-ray diffraction (SAXD) and optical measurements. The third-order nonlinear susceptibilities ({chi}{sup (3)}) were obtained by measuring the THG intensities in LB films of C{sub 60}-Be and comparing with that of CS{sub 2} used as the reference. The value of {chi}{sub xxxx}{sup (3)} (2.1 x 10{sup -11} esu) was deduced at a 65 nm thick films. The {chi}{sup (3)} is attributed to a three-photon near resonance at the energy level of 29410 cm{sup -1}. A new-type of two-chain amphiphilic molecule 1,10-bistearyl-4,6,13, 15-tetra-18-nitrogencrown-6 (NC) was used as insert material to construct mixed C{sub 60}-Be/NC LB films. Our {pi}-A, UV-visible absorption and SAXD measurements showed that the structural improvement in the mixed C{sub 60}-Be/NC LB films was realized by insertion of the C{sub 60}-Be molecules between the two hydrophobic chains of the NC molecules."
"We report here the interfacial behaviour and structure of the Langmuir–Blodgett films of a series of bent-shaped rigid amphiphiles. Molecule 1, based on a shortest oligo(propylene oxide) chain, spontaneously aggregated into short cylinders at the air–water interface. Molecules 2 and 3 formed uniform monolayers at very low surface pressure. Upon compression nanorods appeared. Interestingly, these nanorods self-assemble into spiral rings nanostructures. High-resolution AFM images and UV-vis spectra with polarized light indicate that the nanorods, with a width of 5–8 nm and a length of 10–50 nm, were packed by 2–10 molecules via the π–π interaction of the rigid bent-core lying flat on the substrate. The spiral ring morphologies can be realized through a molecular design and a lateral compression. We suggested that the unusual spiral morphologies are associated with the peculiar rigid bent-shaped core and interfacial molecular interactions, such as capillary force and van der Waals attraction."
"Langmuir and Langmuir−Blodgett films of three new amphiphilic [60]fullerene derivatives have been investigated. The molecular design of these compounds was chosen to control the position of the C60 core relative to the water and to strongly influence the resulting physical properties. The first compound (MonoC8) is a methanofullerene, whereas the two other compounds (BisC8 and BisC12) are C60 cis-2-bis adducts. All of these compounds form stable Langmuir films. Even though the isotherms show some hysteresis, it was possible to transfer the films onto solid substrates, with the Langmuir−Blodgett method for two compounds and the Langmuir−Schaeffer technique for the last one. Grazing-incidence X-ray analysis indicates that LB films have a low roughness, i.e., are of good quality. MonoC8 forms monolayers, whereas the structure of the films of the two other compounds is more complex, with a micellar substructure within the film. These results show how sensitive the molecular design is to the molecular arrangement and to the conformation of the molecules in the films."
"The UV-induced reactivity of dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DLiPE) Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films has been studied by in situ measurements of the changes in the mean molecular area, UV-vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Optimum orientation and packing density of the DLiPE molecules in the monolayer were achieved by adding uranyl acetate to the subphase. A first-order reaction kinetic model was successfully fitted to the experimental reaction kinetics data obtained at a surface pressure of 30 mN/m. Topographical studies of LB films by AFM were performed on bilayer structures as a function of subphase composition and UV irradiation time. The orientational effect of the uranyl ions on the monolayer molecules was observed as an enhanced homogeneity of the freshly prepared monomeric LB films. However, the long-term stability of these films proved to be bad; clear reorganization and loss of a true monolayer structure were evidenced by the AFM images. This instability was inhibited for the UV-irradiated films, indicating that the UV irradiation gave rise to a cross-linked structure."
"In this paper the polydiacetylene (PDA) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, which have potential applications in industry, are studied by using photoacoustic spectrum (PAS) combined with optical absorption and fluorescence spectra. The synthetical analysis of PAS and optical absorption and fluorescence spectra for PDA LB films that underwent environment with different kinds of gases shows that the information about relaxation process of excitation state and feature of elementary excitation can be achieved. Besides, fluorescence quantum efficiency was discussed. The achievment of this paper shows that the PAS technique is a valid means for studying LB films and can capture information which cannot be achieved by other optical spectroscopy."

"Second-harmonic generation from a subwavelength-thick Langmuir-Blodgett film forms an effective dipole oscillator with an essentially one-dimensional radiation pattern. A reflecting boundary is used to suppress $(\ensuremath{\sim}80%)$ and enhance $(\ensuremath{\sim}70%)$ the total rate of radiation from the system compared to its free-space value. The field amplitude between the dipole and the boundary is directly sampled and found to be constant in value, independent of the total rate of radiation. Hence, a nonvanishing field exists inside the system even during suppression of radiation, i.e., when the system loses no energy."
"In this paper we discuss the newly synthesized binuclear species [Cu2(LPY18)2(μ1,1-N3)2(N3)2] (1) and [Cu2(LPY18)2(μ1,3-SCN)2(NCS)2] (2), as obtained from the monometallic precursor [Cu(LPY18)Br2]. These gemini metallosurfactants incorporate metal/anion cascade cores and are investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. Diagnostic IR stretches support the presence of μ1,1-bridged (end-on, 2075 cm−1) azide groups in 1 and μ1,3-bridged (end-to-end, 2117 cm−1) thiocyanate groups in 2. Anion-to-copper LMCT electronic processes at 390 and 440 nm for 1 and at 415 nm for 2 reinforce the nature of the metal/anion cascade cores. Both species are redox-active, magnetically uncoupled due to poor orbital overlap, and robust in the presence of strongly coordinating solvents. At the air–water interface, 1 and 2 yield Langmuir films with high collapse pressures of ca. 60 mN m−1. Domain formation is considerably less extensive than that observed for the related monometallic precursor and the average molecular areas are in good agreement with their modeled molecular size. The resulting Langmuir–Blodgett films are isolated on silica substrates and investigated using IR-reflectance/absorbance spectroscopy."
"There are practical and academic situations that justify the study of calcium carbonate crystallization and especially of systems that are associated with organic matrices and a confined medium. Despite the fact that many different matrices have been studied, the use of well-behaved, thin organic films may provide new knowledge about this system. In this work, we have studied the growth of calcium carbonate particles on well-defined organic matrices that were formed by layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte films deposited on phospholipid Langmuir-Blodgett films (LB). We were able to change the surface electrical charge density of the LB films by changing the proportions of a negatively charged lipid, the sodium salt of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidyl acid (DMPA), and a zwitterionic lipid, dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE). This affects the subsequent polyelectrolyte LbL film deposition, which also changes the the nature of the bonding (electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bonding). This approach allowed for the formation of calcium carbonate particles of different final shapes, roughnesses, and sizes. The masses of deposited lipids, polyelectrolytes, and calcium cabonate were quantified by the quartz crystal microbalance technique. The structures of obtained particles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy."
"Janus-type cellulosic bottlebrushes were synthesized according to grafting-from and grafting-to approaches in combination with click chemistry. The molecular conformation in the solution was characterized by size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser-light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analysis, indicating the bottlebrush products to adopt various conformations in different solvents, forming hemicylinders. The materials are promising, for instance, in the development of novel surfactants, stabilizers for emulsions, Langmuir–Blodgett films or nanocarriers."

"Langmuir-Blodgett films of peripherally unsubstituted phthalocyanine (Pc) have been deposited on substrates of silicon, aluminized silicon and gallium arsenide by means of a precursor compound, dilithium phthalocyanine (Li2Pc), from an aqueous subphase. The resulting films have been chemically and structurally characterized using surface IR reflection spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The results show that the films contain both Li2Pc and metal-free phthalocyanine, indicating that hydrolysis of Li2Pc by the aqueous subphase is not complete, contrary to previous assumptions in the literature. The resulting films are brittle and polycrystalline in nature, with little or no preferred molecular orientation. This behavior is thought to be due to the molecular association of the Li2Pc both in the spreading solution and on the aqueous subphase."
"Amphotericin B (AmB) is an antifungal drug that rarely develops resistance. It has an affinity with the cholesterol on mammalian cell membranes, disrupting the structure and function of the membranes, which are also affected by potassium ions. However, the mechanism is unclear. In this paper, the Langmuir monolayer method was used to study the effects of potassium ions on the surface pressure-mean molecular area of isotherms, elastic modulus and the surface pressure-time curves of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol (DPPC/Chol) monolayer and a DPPC/Chol/AmB monolayer. The morphology and thickness of the Langmuir-Blodgett films were studied via atomic force microscopy. The results showed that AmB can increase the mean molecular area of the DPPC/Chol mixed monolayer at low pressures (15 mN/m) but reduces it at high pressures (30 mN/m). The potassium ions may interfere with the effect of AmB in different ways. The potassium ions can enhance the influence of AmB on the stability of monolayer at low surface pressures, but weaken it at high surface pressures. The potassium ions showed significant interference with the interaction between AmB and the cholesterol-enriched region. The results are helpful for us to understand how the effect of amphotericin B on the phospholipid membrane is interfered with by potassium ions when amphotericin B enters mammalian cell membrane."

"The ion specificity effect on the water solubility of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-containing copolymers complies with the Hofmeister series, which is applicable to other copolymers or not need to be explored. In this work, effects of ionic strength under acidic conditions and ion specificity under alkaline conditions on the air/water interface behavior of two amphiphilic diblock copolymers poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)–poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA-PLMA) were systematically studied. Under acidic conditions, the surface pressure–area isotherms of a predominantly hydrophilic copolymer are insensitive to ionic strength. In contrast, the isotherms of a predominantly hydrophobic copolymer successively shift to the large, small, and large molecular area with the increase of ionic strength. Under alkaline conditions, the interfacial stretch degrees of PDMAEMA chains of two copolymers change with salt species and concentrations, which do not comply with the Hofmeister series. All of the Langmuir–Blodgett films of the former copolymer exhibit separate circular micelles. Nevertheless, those of the latter copolymer obtained under alkaline conditions exhibit various distinctive morphologies such as separate circular micelles, large separate PLMA cores within large PDMAEMA domains, and large PLMA domains/aggregates surrounded by short PDMAEMA shells. It can be attributed to the high deformability of PLMA chains, the ion specificity effect on the stretch degree of PDMAEMA blocks, and their underwater solubility upon compression."

"An ultrathin Langmuir–Blodgett film of tert-butyl silicon-[bis ethyloxy]-phthalocyanine (tbPcSi(OC2H5)2) has been investigated as an interesting candidate for the detection of nitrogen dioxide gas at a concentration of 5 ppm (by volume). Surface-pressure area isotherms reveal an area per molecule of around 80 Å2 and that a compact ‘solid’ phase occurs in the region 10–30 mN m−1. Five layer LB films were deposited onto gold interdigitated electrodes on glass in order to facilitate I–V measurements and assess the conductometric sensing properties in response to 5 ppm NO2. The I–V characteristic is Ohmic and yields a conductivity in the range 3.4 × 10−6 to 5.9 × 10−6 (Ω cm)−1 which is comparable to that obtained for other phthalocyanine monomers. Exposing the LB films to NO2 results in an increase in current (for a 5 V bias) by a factor of 8 and a response time (t50) of approximately 200 s. Preliminary UV–vis spectroscopic investigations indicate that the film also responds optically."
"Eight new oligomeric mesogens are reported, consisting of an azobenzene-based core attached to which are four 4-cyanobiphenyl units via flexible alkyl spacers (n = 5–12). Their chemical structures were determined by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermotropic liquid crystalline properties of these materials were investigated by POM, DSC and XRD. The oligomers containing n = 8 and n = 10 were found to exhibit a monotropic nematic (N) phase while others were non-mesomorphic. Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett films of the nematic compounds (n = 10) were studied at the air–water interface (Langmuir film) and the air–solid interface. Surface manometry studies on the Langmuir monolayer showed that the film had nearly zero surface pressure at a large area per molecule (Am ≥ 0.55 nm2). The film on compression showed a gradual increase in surface pressure and finally collapsed at an Am of about 0.15 nm2 with a collapse pressure of about 60 mN m−1. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images (during compression) showed that dark regions coexisting with grey spots in large areas transformed to a uniform grey region with an increase in surface density and finally collapsed exhibiting bright regions. Atomic force microscopy studies (AFM) on the LB films, transferred onto freshly cleaved hydrophilic mica substrates, exhibited a network of thin fibers with the height of fibers varying between ∼4 nm to 80 nm which could be due to π–π stacking and dipolar interactions associated with the cyanobiphenyl units. On a hydrophobic silicon substrate, the LB transfer yielded a multilayer film which dewetted to form nanodroplets. We carried out temperature dependent AFM studies of the nematic compounds which showed the reversible formation of aligned fibers (∼20 to 40 μm) in the mesophase. In brief, our study provides new approaches for the realization of controlling the anisotropic properties of an ordered phase."
"Ferroelectric polymers show interesting peculiarities in spite of some constraints, which limit the number of possible materials. These constraints are compact crystal structure, conformational flexibility and minimal steric hindrance. One of the important properties of the ferroelectric polymers is the simple method of the nanostructures preparation. The present paper is devoted to the review of switching and ferroelectric properties of ultrathin copolymer Langmuir-Blodgett films and nanocrystals from vinylidene fluoride copolymer."
"Silver nanoparticles have been widely studied for their distinct optoelectronic properties as well as their potent antimicrobial behavior. While these properties lend themselves to a host of applications ranging from sensors to biomedical applications to water purification, an important challenge is in developing experimental methods for the synthesis, assembly, and immobilization of silver nanoparticles over a range of sizes, shapes, and surface chemistry on different surfaces. This chapter will provide an overview on physical, chemical, as well as biological methods to produce silver nanoparticles and their immobilization on different surfaces such as Langmuir–Blodgett films, self-assembled monolayers, and renewable materials, to name a few. This chapter will discuss in some detail potential applications of immobilized silver nanoparticles."
"The paper identifies ten market areas for sensors and then concentrates on the special characteristics, requirements and technologies of the industrial sector with its market purchases of US$2.8 Billion annually. The particular characteristics of this market are variety and a relatively long gestation period between the breadboard and the fully accepted and engineered product. The treatment of the subject and the definition of the word ‘recent’ in the title is related in the first half of the paper towards the fully engineered quantity production end of sensor development rather than on original research work much of which never reaches industrial usage. Some twenty examples, selected by the author, of interesting recent developments are briefly described. These were chosen on the basis of their technical interest and innovatory measurement principles rather than on their industrial importance. The latter part of the paper deals with potentially important technologies likely to influence sensor developments of the future such as Langmuir-Blodgett films and to mention in passing our Prime Minister's erstwhile scientific contribution to this topic."
"Summary Well-defined Langmuir-Blodgett films prepared by reproducible technique are still highly attractive for exploitation in investigation of subjects as diverse as chain packing, phase transitions, two-dimensional physics, biosensors and membrane physics. During last 15 years the Maxwell displacement current (MDC) measuring technique was developed for dynamic study of monolayers. In experiment MDC flows through the metal electrode/air gap/Langmuir monolayer/water surface structure. Spontaneous formation of the monolayer was observed and significant differences between destructive and non-destructive processes are discussed."
"Bottom-up construction of nanoporous thin films with nanometer-scale controllability of film thickness and pore size persists as a key challenge for molecular separation and sensing materials with effective and selective molecular transportation ability. This report describes the controlled ion permeability of ultrathin nanoporous SiO2 thin films with nanometer-scale controllability of the film thickness and pore size prepared from blend polymer Langmuir–Blodgett films (nanosheets) consisting of poly(N-dodecyl acrylamide) (pDDA) and silsesquioxane (SQ)-containing random copolymer (p(DDA/SQ26)). Nanoporous SiO2 thin films were prepared using photo-oxidation methods of p(DDA/SQ26) blend nanosheets under ambient conditions. The SiO2 nanofilms exhibited tunable nanoporous structures with a wide range of porosity from 0.06 to 0.79. The film thickness was controlled to ca. 0.4 nm layer–1 using varying numbers of deposition cycles. Furthermore, the average pore size was controlled with nanometer-scale accuracy by varying the p(DDA/SQ26) random copolymer ratio. Consequently, the size-selective ion permeability of nanoporous SiO2 thin films was demonstrated by using two redox probes [Fc(CN)63– and Ru(NH3)62+], which have a similar molecular size. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that the two probes exhibited the same permeation behavior in terms of the relative current density at high ionic strength conditions. These results demonstrate that ultrathin nanoporous SiO2 films converted from p(DDA/SQ26) blend nanosheets are promising for the effective and selective molecular transportation for molecular separation and sensing applications."
"Most affinity sensor principles demand immobilized receptor molecules. A widely used multiple-step technique for covalent immobilization of proteins is based on a silanization procedure and a crosslinking agent, e.g., glutardialdehyde. In the presented work non- amphophilic Langmuir-Blodgett films based on phthalocy-aninato-polysiloxane derivatives or copolyglutamates are used to immobilize antibodies as monolayers. Due to a photopolymerization process of terminal C-C-double bonds at alkylic side chains of the non- amphophilic substance the stability of the films is improved compared to conventional LB films. Antibodies can be immobilized by a one-step-method subsequent to illumination. Polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) fibers are found to be ideal substrates for the antibody transfer. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) give quite good specificities and densities of active immobilized immunoglobulin (IgG). For antigen detection these films are combined with compact evanescent wave sensors. Antibodies were immobilized at the surface of a waveguide using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The light source is a diode laser, which results in a small and compact set-up and due to the red excitation wavelength the background fluorescence is reduced."
