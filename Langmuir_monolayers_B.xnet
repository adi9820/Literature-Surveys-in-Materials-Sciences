"The dye, Methylene Blue, was adsorbed on an adsorbent prepared from mature leaves of the Neem tree (Azadirachta indica). A batch adsorption study was carried out with variable adsorbate concentration, adsorbent amount, pH, and temperature. Ninety-three percent of the dye could be removed by 2 g of the Neem leaf powder from 1 L of an aqueous solution containing 25 mg of the dye at 300 K. The adsorption followed pseudo first order kinetics with a mean rate constant of 3.73 × 10−3 min−1 and an intra-particle diffusion rate constant of 6.36 × 10−2 mg g−1 min−0.5. A possible mechanism of adsorption was suggested on the basis of concurrently operating surface adsorption and pore diffusion. The experimental data yielded excellent fits with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. The Langmuir monolayer capacity had a mean value of 8.76 mg g−1. The adsorption of the dye was endothermic in nature (ΔH: 4.62–16.74 kJ mol−1) and was accompanied by an increase in entropy (ΔS: 54.22–90.23 J mol−1 K−1) and a decrease in Gibbs energy (ΔG: −10.33 to −13.62 kJ mol−1 in the temperature range of 300–330 K). The results indicated that the dye, Methylene Blue, strongly interacts with a biomass-based adsorbent, the Neem leaf powder."
"Laboratory investigations show that the ultimate capacity of granular carbon for adsorption of biochemically-resistant organic substances from dilute solution after a sufficient period of contact is on the order of 15% to 25% by weight. Experimental adsorption isotherms for a number of organic substances indicate that adsorption equilibria for solutions of micromolar concentration are well-described by the Langmuir monolayer adsorption theory. Adsorption equilibria for solutions of high concentration appear to be best described by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller multilayer theory. Interpretation of observed data leads to the conclusion that different types of adsorbed films are formed for high and low concentrations in solution at equilibrium with carbon; the data appear to reveal a range of activities for various parts of the surface area of the adsorbent. Ultimate capacities increase with decreasing temperature, decreasing pH, and decreasing particle size."
"This paper presents the synthesis of iron(III)−aluminum(III) mixed oxide with some of its physicochemical characteristics and fluoride adsorption behavior thereon. Results showed that the optimum initial pH for fluoride adsorption is 4.0−10.0, and the equilibrium time required is 1.5 h. The isotherm data follow the order Redlich−Peterson ≥ Langmuir > Freundlich > Temkin. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is determined to be 17.73 mg/g, which is higher than that of either of the pure oxides. The enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) for the adsorption reaction are +29.31 kJ/mol and +116.75 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. The adsorption is endothermic in nature. The kinetics follows a pseudo-second-order rate equation, and the reaction rate is a multistage-controlled diffusion process. The activation energy for this adsorption reaction is 6.35 kJ/mol."
"The adsorption behavior of nickel(II) from aqueous solution onto agricultural waste such as cashew nut shell (CNS) was investigated as a function of parameters such as solution pH, CNS dose, contact time, initial nickel(II) concentration and temperature. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms using nonlinear regression analysis. The equilibrium data fits well for the both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of CNS was found to be 18.868 mg/g. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° have also been evaluated and it has been found that the sorption process was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models were used to describe the kinetic data and the rate constants were evaluated. The result of the kinetic study shows that the adsorption of nickel(II) could be described by the pseudo-second-order equation, suggesting that the adsorption process is presumably chemisorption. The adsorption process was found to be controlled by both surface and pore diffusion, with surface diffusion at the earlier stages followed by pore diffusion at the later stages. Analysis of adsorption data using a Boyd kinetic plot confirmed that external mass transfer is the rate determining step in the sorption process. A single-stage batch adsorber was designed for different CNS dose/effluent volume ratios using the Freundlich equation."
"In this study, iron oxide activated red mud (IOARM) was used effectively to adsorb Cd(II) from aqueous solution. The optimized adsorption parameters were: pH 6.0, dose 6.0 g/L, contact time 90 min, initial concentration 400 μg/L and temperature 300 K. Adsorption followed Freundlich isotherm model. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was 117.64, 116.28 and 107.53 μg/g, while Freundlich adsorption capacity, kF, was 3.83, 3.68 and 3.07 μg/g at 293, 298 and 308 K, respectively. The adsorption capacities in both isotherms decreased with temperature indicating exothermic nature of process. Change in Gibb's free energy was − 9.93, − 10.97 and − 11.36 kJ/mol at 293, 298 and 308 K, respectively, indicating spontaneity and feasibility of the process. The enthalpy change was found to be 7.27 kJ/mol indicating physical adsorption of Cd(II) onto IOARM. Adsorption followed pseudo-second order kinetics with intraparticle and film diffusion mechanisms. The exhausted IOARM was regenerated using 0.1 HNO3 and used five times. The results indicated that IOARM is a promising adsorbent for removal of Cd(II) from water under natural conditions."
"The removal of Ni(II) and Cu(II) with clays (kaolinite, montmorillonite and their acid-activated forms) in aqueous medium have been studied. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out by considering various solution pH, interaction time, and temperature. The adsorption was strongly dependent on pH of the medium. The uptake was very fast initially and maximum adsorption was observed within 180 and 360 min of agitation for Ni(II) and Cu(II), respectively. The kinetics of the interactions was best described by second order mechanism. The adsorption data yielded Langmuir monolayer capacity as 4.3–28.0 and 7.1–21.3 mg g−1 for clay-Cu(II) and clay-Ni(II) interaction, respectively. Adsorption of Ni(II) and Cu(II) followed exothermic and endothermic paths, respectively. The results showed that kaolinite and montmorillonite and their acid-activated forms are good adsorbents for Ni(II) and Cu(II) in aqueous medium."
"This paper presents the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqua solutions onto Unye (Turkey) bentonite in raw (RB), acid activated (AAB) and manganese oxide-coated (MCB) forms. Adsorption of Pb(II) by RB, AAB and MCB sample was investigated as a function of the initial Pb(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature and inorganic ligand (Cl(-)). Changes in the surfaces and structure were characterized by means of XRD, IR and potentiometric titration. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of RB, AAB and MCB in 0.1M KNO(3) solution were estimated as 16.70, 8.92 and 58.88 mg/g, respectively. The spontaneity of the adsorption process is established by decrease in DeltaG which varied from -21.60 to -28.60 kJ/mol (RB), -22.63 to -29.98 kJ/mol (AAB) and -19.57 to -26.22 (MCB) in temperature range 303-338 K."
"The present study investigates the immobilization of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II) on clays (kaolinite and montmorillonite) in aqueous medium through the process of adsorption under a set of variables (concentration of metal ion, amount of clay, pH, time and temperature of interaction). Increasing pH favours the removal of metal ions till they are precipitated as the insoluble hydroxides. The uptake is rapid with maximum adsorption being observed within 180 min for Pb(II) and Ni(II) and 240 min for Cd(II). A number of available models like the Lagergren pseudo first-order kinetics, second-order kinetics, Elovich equation, liquid film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion are utilized to evaluate the kinetics and the mechanism of the immobilization interactions. Two isotherm equations due to Langmuir and Freundlich showed good fits with the experimental data. Kaolinite and montmorillonite have considerable Langmuir monolayer capacity with respect to Pb(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II), the values being in the range of 6.8–11.5 mg/g (kaolinite) and 21.1–31.1 mg/g (montmorillonite). The Freundlich adsorption capacity follows a similar order. The thermodynamics of the immobilization process indicates the same to be exothermic with Pb(II) and Ni(II), but endothermic with Cd(II). The interactions with Pb(II) and Ni(II) are accompanied by decrease in entropy and Gibbs energy while the endothermic immobilization of Cd(II) is supported by an increase in entropy and an appreciable decrease in Gibbs energy. The results have established good potentiality for kaolinite and montmorillonite to remove heavy metals like Pb(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous medium through adsorption-mediated immobilization."
"The potential of a low-cost Nigerian montmorillonite for the adsorption of Ni(II) and Mn(II) ions from aqueous solution was investigated by batch mode. XRD, SEM and BET analysis were used to characterize the adsorbent. The experiments were performed as a function of pH, particle size, adsorbent dose, initial metal ion concentration, contact time, ligands and temperature. The process was found to be dependent on all the parameters investigated, with a pH of 6.0 obtained for optimum removal of both metal ions. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of 166.67 and 142.86 mg/g was obtained for Ni(II) and Mn(II) ions respectively. The Freundlich isotherm gave the best fit to the experimental data than the Langmuir, Temkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherms. The scatchard plot analysis indicated the existence of more than one type of active site on the montmorillonite which corroborates the good fit of the Freundlich model. The pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to the kinetic data. The best fit was achieved with the pseudo-first order model and the existence of intraparticle diffusion mechanism was indicated. Thermodynamic studies showed an endothermic, dissociative, spontaneous and a physical adsorption process between the metal ions and the montmorillonite. Desorption studies revealed over 90% desorption of both metal ions from the metal loaded adsorbent."
"A new adsorbent, the fallen phoenix tree's leaf, has been investigated in order to remove methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. Variables of the system, including contact time, leaf dose, solution pH, salt concentration and initial MB concentration, were adopted to study their effects on MB biosorption. The results showed that as the dose of leaf increased, the percentage of MB sorption increased accordingly. There was no significant difference about the quantity of MB adsorbed onto leaf as the pH was within the range 4.5–10.0. The salt concentration has negative effect on MB removal. The equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir and the Freundlich isotherms. The results of non-linear regressive analysis are that the Langmuir isotherm is better fit than the Freundlich isotherm at different temperature according to the values of determined coefficients (R2) and χ2-statistic (SS). The Langmuir monolayer saturation capacities of MB adsorbed onto leaf are 80.9, 83.8, 89.7 mg g−1 at 295, 309 and 323 K, respectively. Using the equilibrium concentration contents obtained at different temperatures, various thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS°, have been calculated. The thermodynamics parameters of MB/leaf system indicate spontaneous and endothermic process. It was concluded that an increase in temperature be advantage to adsorb MB onto leaf."
"The present work investigates the adsorptive interactions of Ni(II) ions with kaolinite, montmorillonite, and their poly(oxo zirconium) and tetrabutylammonium derivatives in aqueous medium. Batch adsorption studies were carried out with various Ni(II) concentrations, amount of clay adsorbents, pH, agitation time and temperature. The adsorption is strongly dependent on pH of the medium with enhanced adsorption as the pH turns from acidic to alkaline side till precipitation sets in. The process was very fast initially and maximum adsorption was observed within 180 min of agitation. The kinetics of the interactions, tested with pseudo first order Lagergren equation, second order kinetics, Elovich equation, liquid film diffusion model and intra-particle diffusion mechanism, showed better agreement with second order kinetics (k2 = 1.3 x 10(-2) to 5.3 x 10(-2) g/(mg min)). The adsorption data gave good fits with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and yielded Langmuir monolayer capacity of 2.75 to 21.14 mg/g and Freundlich adsorption capacity of 0.70 to 3.40 mg(1-1/n) l(1/n)/g for the clay adsorbents. The adsorption process was exothermic with Delta H in the range of -24.0 to -45.1 kJ/mol accompanied by decrease in entropy (DeltaS: -118.2 to -160.5 J/(mol K)) and Gibbs energy (Delta G: -34.6 to -49.5 kJ/mol). The results have shown that montmorillonite has the largest adsorption capacity followed by ZrO-montmorillonite, TBA-montmorillonite, kaolinite, ZrO-kaolinite and TBA-kaolinite. Introduction of ZrO- and TBA- groups into the clays reduced their adsorption capacity by blocking the available adsorption sites."
"In the present study, the removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution have been studied by using a newly prepared biosorbents from Spirulina platensis (SP). SEM-EDX, FTIR and XRD analyses of the biosorbents have been reported. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of ultrasonic assisted SP (UASP) for Cu(II) ions (817.7 mg/g) was found to be higher as compared with raw SP (RSP) and sulphuric acid modified SP (SMSP). Adsorption kinetics and isotherms of Cu(II) ions onto UASP followed the pseudo-first order and Freundlich models. Adsorption process was measured as exothermic and spontaneous in nature. UASP showed higher affinity for Cu(II) ions."
"The adsorption behavior of crystal violet (CV+) from aqueous solution onto a manganese oxide-coated (MCS) sepiolite sample was investigated as a function of parameters such as initial CV+ concentration, contact time and temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of MCS was estimated as 319 mg/g. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic and the intraparticle diffusion models were used to describe the kinetic data and rate constants were evaluated. The values of the energy (Ea) , enthalpy (∆H≠) and entropy of activation (∆S≠) were 56.45 kJ/mol, 53.90 kJ/mol and − 117.26 J/(mol K), respectively, at pH 6.5. The quite high adsorption capacity and high adsorption rate of MCS will provide an important advantage for use of this material in basic dye solutions."
"Interactions of kaolinite and its modified forms, acid-activated kaolinite, poly(oxozirconium) kaolinite, and tetrabutylammonium kaolinite, have been investigated for their utilization as adsorbents for Cr(VI) in aqueous medium. The variables are Cr(VI) concentration, amount of kaolinite or its modified forms, pH, interaction time, and temperature. The adsorption is strongly dependent on the pH of the medium with Cr(VI) uptake increasing from pH 1.0 to pH 7.0, after which the uptake decreases. The process attains equilibrium within 240 min. The kinetics of the interactions is tested with respect to pseudo-first-order, second-order, Elovich, liquid film diffusion, and intraparticle diffusion models, and it is seen that the interactions do not follow a simple model. The adsorption process, however, gives a good fit with both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. The Langmuir monolayer capacity of the clay adsorbents is from 10.6 to 13.9 mg g-1. The adsorption process is endothermic (ΔH = 30.4−63.9 kJ mol-1) accompanied by an increase in entropy (ΔS = 88.4−198.1 J mol-1 K-1) and decrease in Gibbs energy. The results have shown that acid-activated kaolinite has the largest adsorption capacity followed by nonactivated kaolinite, ZrO−kaolinite, and TBA−kaolinite."
"Adsorption of Cu(II) by raw bentonite (RB) and acid-activated bentonite (AAB) samples was investigated as a function of the initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature, the competitive and complexation effects of ligands (Cl-, SO4(2-), PO4(3-)). Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the RB (42.41 mg g(-1)) was found greater than that of the AAB (32.17 mg g(-1)). The effect of structural charges on the reactivity of the edge groups was evidenced by the particular proton adsorption behaviour of the bentonite samples. The spontaneity of the adsorption process is established by decrease in DeltaG which varied from -0.34 to -0.71 kJ mol(-1) (RB), -1.13 to -1.49 kJ mol(-1) (AAB) in temperature range 303-313 K. Infrared (IR) spectra of the bentonite samples showed that the positions and shapes of the fundamental vibrations of the OH and Si-O groups were influenced by the adsorbed Cu(II) cations. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) results showed that adsorbed Cu(II) cations have a great effect on the thermal behaviour of the bentonite samples. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicated that the Cu(II) adsorption onto the bentonite samples led to changes in unit cell dimensions and symmetry of the parent bentonites."
"Kaolinite and montmorillonite have been used as adsorbents for Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) in aqueous medium. The effect of different variables, namely, concentration of metal ions, amount of clay adsorbents, pH, time and temperature of interaction was investigated. Adsorption increased with pH till precipitation of insoluble hydroxides became dominant. The equilibrium time was 300, 240 and 180 min for Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) respectively, the processes conforming to second order kinetics. Montmorillonite had a much higher adsorption capacity for the metal ions with the Langmuir monolayer capacity (qm) of 28.4 to 28.9 mg g− 1 compared to that of 10.4 to 11.2 mg g− 1 for kaolinite. All the interactions were exothermic except those between Co(II) and kaolinite. The adsorption processes were accompanied by an appreciable decrease in Gibbs energy. Both kaolinite and montmorillonite were observed to be suitable for treating water contaminated with Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II)."
"This paper presents the adsorption of Cu(II) from aqueous solution on modified Unye bentonite. Adsorption of Cu(II) by manganase oxide modified bentonite (MMB) sample was investigated as a function of the initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature and inorganic ligands (Cl−, SO42−, HPO42−). Changes in the surfaces and structure were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, N2 gas adsorption and potentiometric titration data. The adsorption properties of raw bentonite (RB) were further improved by modification with manganese oxide. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the MMB (105.38 mg/g) was found greater than that of the raw bentonite (42.41 mg/g). The spontaneity of the adsorption process is established by decrease in ΔG which varied from −4.68 to −5.10 kJ mol−1 in temperature range 303–313 K. The high performance exhibited by MMB was attributed to increased surface area and higher negative surface charge after modification."
"An unmodified Nigerian kaolinite clay (UAK) was utilized as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of Ni(II) and Mn(II) ions from a binary solution of both metal ions. Batch adsorption methodology was used to evaluate the effect of solution pH, initial metal ion concentration, sorbent dose, particle size, contact time, temperature and ligand on adsorption. FTIR, XRD and SEM analysis were used to characterize the adsorbent. The equilibrium isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherm model. The Freundlich isotherm model provided the best fit to the experimental data for both metal ions as indicated by the values of the regression coefficient. The Langmuir monolayer maximum adsorption capacities for Ni(II) and Mn(II) ions are 166.67 mg/g and 111.11 mg/g, respectively. The kinetic data were analyzed using the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order equations, the Elovich equation and intraparticle diffusion rate equation. The Elovich equation gave the best fit to the experimental data for both metal ions. The presence of intraparticle diffusion mechanism was indicated, although it was not the sole rate determining step. Thermodynamic studies indicated an endothermic, spontaneous and a physisorption process between both metal ions and UAK. The results showed that the kaolinite can be utilized as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of Ni(II) and Mn(II) ions from solution."
"The preparation of magnesium hydroxide coated bentonite, B–Mg(OH)2 composite, and its capacity to remove anionic reactive dyes; Procion blue HP (PB) and Remazol brilliant blue R (RB) from aqueous solution were reported in this study. The adsorbent was characterized by X-ray fluorescence analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, Brunauer Emmett Teller surface area analysis; scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effectiveness of B–Mg(OH)2 composite to remove dyes was examined at different initial concentrations, pH, temperature and ionic strengths. At pH = 2, the maximum dye adsorption was found as 98.2% for RB and 87.8% for PB. Kinetic studies revealed that adsorption follows a pseudo-second-order model, and rate constants were evaluated. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of PB and RB in aqueous solution were estimated at 298 K as 40.22 and 66.90 mg/g, respectively. A temperature uptake from 278 K to 313 K induced an increase of adsorption for both dyes and the process was found to be physiosorptive, endothermic and spontaneous. Higher concentration or more valence of anions of electrolytes in dye solution caused decreasing dye adsorption efficiency of B–Mg(OH)2 composite."
"The adsorptive interactions of Pb(II) ions with kaolinite, montmorillonite, and their acid activated derivatives in aqueous medium are investigated in this work. The adsorption experiments were carried out under batch process with Pb(II) concentration, amount of clay, pH, time and temperature as the variables. The adsorption was strongly dependent on pH of the medium, and the uptake of Pb(II) increased from pH 1.0 to 6.0 after which the experiments could not be continued due to decreasing solubility of Pb(II). Adsorption was very fast at low coverage and equilibrium was approached within 180 min. The results best fitted the second order kinetic model with the rate constant, k2, in the range of 3.5 × 10−2 to 11.2 × 10−2 g mg−1 min−1. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were applied and isotherm coefficients were computed. The Langmuir monolayer capacity of the clay adsorbents was from 11.5 to 31.4 mg g−1. The adsorption process was exothermic (ΔH = −58.9 to −83.4 kJ mol−1) accompanied by decrease in entropy (ΔS = −116.4 to −258.7 J mol−1 K−1) and Gibbs energy (ΔG = −35.8 to −79.6 kJ mol−1). The results are discussed to highlight the influence of acid activation on Pb(II)-adsorption characteristics of the clays."
"The present work investigates the influence of acid activation of montmorillonite on adsorption of Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Pb(II) from aqueous medium and comparison of the adsorption capacities with those on parent montmorillonite. The clay-metal interactions were studied under different conditions of pH, concentration of metal ions, amount of clay, interaction time, and temperature. The interactions were dependent on pH and the uptake was controlled by the amount of clay and the initial concentration of the metal ions. The adsorption capacity of acid-activated montmorillonite increases for all the metal ions. The interactions were adsorptive in nature and relatively fast and the rate processes more akin to the second-order kinetics. The adsorption data fitted both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, indicating that strong forces were responsible for the interactions at energetically nonuniform sites. The Langmuir monolayer capacity of the acid-activated montmorillonite is more than that of the parent montmorillonite (Cd(II): 32.7 and 33.2 mg/g; Co(II): 28.6 and 29.7 mg/g; Cu(II): 31.8 and 32.3 mg/g; Pb(II): 33.0 and 34.0 mg/g; and Ni(II): 28.4 and 29.5 mg/g for montmorillonite and acid-activated montmorillonite, respectively). The thermodynamics of the rate processes showed the adsorption of Co(II), Pb(II), and Ni(II) to be exothermic, accompanied by decreases in entropy and Gibbs free energy, while the adsorption of Cd(II) and Cu(II) was endothermic, with an increase in entropy and an appreciable decrease in Gibbs free energy. The results have established the potential use for montmorillonite and its acid-activated form as adsorbents for Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Pb(II) ions from aqueous media."
"Effects of process variables namely pH, dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature, particle size and agitation speed on kinetics of methylene blue adsorption onto gulmohar plant leaf powder were investigated. Quadratic models were proposed to predict pseudo second order rate constant and equilibrium uptake in terms of the process variables. Model coefficients were determined by multiple regression analysis. Statistical tools like Student's t-test, F-test, ANOVA and lack-of-fit were used to define the most important process variables. The proposed models could predict the rate constant and equilibrium dye uptake with high R(2) values (0.94 and 0.947). It was found that rate constant increased with decrease in concentration, decrease in particle size, increase in adsorbent dosage, increase in agitation speed and increase in temperature. Meanwhile, it was found that equilibrium dye uptake increased with increase in concentration and decrease in dosage. Apart from these combined effects of the process variables were established through multiple regression analysis. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of GUL was found to be 186.22 mg/g."
"Interactions of Cu(II) ions with clays (kaolinite, montmorillonite and their acid-activated forms) were studied in an equilibrium batch process. The experiments were conducted with pH, interaction time, concentration of Cu(II) ions, amount of clay and temperature as the variables. More and more Cu(II) ions were held at the clay surface till precipitation occurred at pH > 6.0. The interactions were rapid at the commencement of the process and equilibrium was attained within 360 min. Various kinetic models, viz. Lagergren first order, second order, Elovich equation, intra-particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion model were tested, and the data more closely resembled a second order process. The clays had reasonable Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of 9.2, 10.1, 31.8 and 32.3 mg g− 1 for kaolinite, acid activated kaolinite, montmorillonite and acid-activated montmorillonite respectively. Montmorillonite surface held much more Cu(II) ions than kaolinite and this capacity was further boosted by acid activation in case of both kaolinite and montmorillonite. The interactions were endothermic, driven entropy increase and Gibbs energy decrease. Kaolinite, montmorillonite and their acid-activated forms in aqueous suspension have good potential to remove Cu(II) ions through adsorption-mediated surface immobilization."
"The aim of this work was to study the adsorption behavior of the nanosilica-containing hydrogel nanocomposite of gum karaya grafted with poly(acrylic acid−acrylamide) (GK-cl-P(AA-co-AAM)) in the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The hydrogel nanocomposite was synthesized by the base-catalyzed hydrolysis and water condensation reactions of tetraethylorthosilicate in an aqueous medium containing a dispersion of GK-cl-P(AA-co-AAM). Structural and morphological characterizations using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission and scanning electron microscopies supported the formation of the grafted hydrogel polymer of GK and the SiO2-containing nanocomposite. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller adsorption studies showed that the surface area and porosity of the hydrogel polymer significantly increased after nanocomposite formation with SiO2. The hydrogel nanocomposite was employed for the removal of MB from an aqueous solution: 96% of the MB was removed with a hydrogel nanocomposite dose of 0.2 g L−1. The adsorption process was found to follow pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption isotherm was best fitted with the Langmuir monolayer isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1408.67 mg g−1, which was much higher than that of the hydrogel polymer. Different adsorption thermodynamic parameters supported the endothermic nature as well as the spontaneity of the adsorption process. The hydrogel nanocomposite showed excellent regeneration capacity in the acidic medium and was successfully used over three adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the GK-cl-P(AA-co-AAM)/SiO2 hydrogel nanocomposite has shown potential as an efficient adsorbent for the highly effective removal of cationic dyes from aqueous solution."
"In the present investigation, adsorbent activated charcoal was prepared from wood apple shell by chemical activation and used for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solutions. Powdered wood apple shell was activated by acid H2SO4 and heat treatment in muffle furnace at 600 °C for 2 h. The specific surface area of prepared activated carbon was found to be 1898 m2 g−1. Batch adsorption studies reveal that the prepared activated charcoal has a significant capacity for adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms investigated in this study include Langmuir and Freundlich at 300 K. The Cr(VI) adsorption was found to be maximum (>95.0%) at pH 1.8. Very small amount of adsorbent activated carbon (1.25 g L−1) could remove >95.0% Cr(VI) from aqueous solution of initial concentration 75 mg L−1. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) adsorption on activated carbon was found to be 151.51 mg g−1. The dimensionless separation factor (RL) signifies a favorable adsorption of Cr(VI) on activated charcoal. Adsorption kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto activated carbon was pseudo-second order chemisorptions and follows film-diffusion as well as intra-particle pore-diffusion mechanism."
"The effect of temperature on the sorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution onto palm kernel fibre has been studied. Batch kinetics and isotherm studies were performed at temperatures ranging from 299 to 339 K. The kinetic data were studied in terms of the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the Bangham and intraparticle diffusion models. The pseudo-second-order model best described the sorption process and was employed in predicting the rate constant, equilibrium sorption capacity and the initial sorption rate with effect of temperature. In addition activation energy of sorption has also been determined based on the pseudo-second-order rate constant. The isotherm data was analyzed by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Palm kernel fibre was found to have a Langmuir monolayer capacity of 233.41 mg g−1 at 299 K. The adsorption is endothermic at ambient temperature and the computation of the thermodynamic parameters, ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG° indicates that the sorption was favourable at all temperatures."
"Two of the most common clay minerals, kaolinite and montmorillonite, were allowed to interact with the cationic dye, Rhodamine B in aqueous solution. The clay minerals were used along with those modified by treatment with 0.25 and 0.50 M H2SO4. The influences of pH, interaction time, clay mineral amount, dye concentration and temperature on the adsorption process were monitored and explained on the basis of physico-chemical characteristics of the clay minerals and the behaviour of the dye molecules. The optimum pH for Rhodamine B adsorption was 4.0. The interactions attained equilibrium in ~ 180 min and the rate processes followed second order kinetics. It was observed that montmorillonite had a Langmuir monolayer capacity of more than eight times that of kaolinite. The modified clay minerals showed slightly higher adsorption capacity than the raw clay minerals. Adsorption was endothermic with enthalpy of adsorption increasing with rise in temperature and the endothermic interactions were driven by increase in entropy and decrease in Gibbs energy. The results suggested that the dye can be separated from aqueous solution by both clay minerals."
"The adsorption potential of the Egyptian Na-activated bentonite (Na-AB) to remove Pb(II), Cd(II), and Ni(II) from synthetic ternary-ion solutions and contaminated seawater, was investigated for the first time. In this study, natural Egyptian Ca-bentonite was activated to Na-AB, which then was characterized using XRF, XRD, FT-IR, and BET. The adsorption process was strongly influenced by pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, metal concentration, agitation speed, and temperature. The isotherm equations due to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models showed good fits with the experimental data. Na-AB has a Langmuir monolayer capacity in a decreasing order of; Pb(II) (5.43 mg/g) > Cd(II) (3.14 mg/g) > Ni(II) (2.77 mg/g), these are considered high capacity values relative to the initial concentration (10 mg/L of each metal). The adsorption selectivity was interpreted by means of atomic radii, charge density and hydration enthalpy. The multi-component adsorption kinetics was more accurately described by pseudo-second-order model. The intraparticle diffusion model gave multi-linear curves, so more than one-step controlled the adsorption process. Activation energy was calculated as 17.54, 13.73, and 28.66 kJ mol−1 for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Ni(II) respectively, suggesting physical adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures (290–328) K showed that (i) Pb(II) adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic, (ii) Cd(II) adsorption was non-spontaneous and endothermic, (iii) Ni(II) adsorption was non-spontaneous and exothermic. Application study on polluted seawater, showed removal efficiency within range of 92–100% not only for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Ni(II) but also for other co-existing metals like Cu(II), Mn(II), Cr(III), and Zn(II)."
"The adsorption behavior of crystal violet (CV(+)) from aqueous solution onto magnesium-oxide coated bentonite (MCB) sample was investigated as a function of parameters such as initial CV(+) concentration, contact time and temperature. The Langmuir, and Freundlich adsorption models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of MCB were estimated as 496 mg/g. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order kinetic and the intra-particle diffusion models were used to describe the kinetic data and rate constants were evaluated. The values of the energy (E(a)), enthalpy (Delta H(not equal)) and entropy of activation (DeltaS(not equal)) were 56.45 kJ/mol, 53.90 kJ/mol and -117.26 J/mol K, respectively, at pH 6.5."
"In this study, cotton boll was used as an adsorbent for the aim of removing of the Cu(II) ions from the aqueous solutions. The adsorption process was carried out in a batch process and the effects of contact time (2-24h), adsorbent concentration (1-20 g l(-1)), initial pH (2.0-6.0), initial metal ion concentration (20-160 mg l(-1)) and temperature (20-45 degrees C) on the adsorption were investigated. Experimental results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity was determined at pH 5.0 and adsorbed Cu(II) ion concentration was increased with increasing adsorbent concentration and contact time. The isothermal data of cotton boll could be well described by the Langmuir equations and the Langmuir monolayer capacity had a mean value of 11.40 mg g(-1). Experimental results indicated that the pseudo-second order reaction model provided the best description of the data with a correlation coefficient 0.99 for different initial metal concentrations and therefore it was explained that chemical sorption was the basic mechanism in this system. FT-IR results showed that oxygen and nitrogen atoms in structure of cotton boll were involved in Cu(II) ions adsorption."
"This paper presents the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solution onto Unye (Turkey) bentonite in raw (RB), iron oxide-coated (ICB) and magnesium oxide-coated (MCB) forms. Adsorption of Pb(II) by samples was investigated as a function of the initial Pb(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature and inorganic ligand effect (Cl(-)). Changes in the surface and structure were characterized by means of XRD and N(2) gas adsorption data. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of RB, ICB and MCB in 0.1M KNO(3) solution were estimated as 16.70, 22.20 and 31.86 mg/g, respectively. The spontaneity of the adsorption process is established by decrease in DeltaG which varied from -21.60 to -28.60 kJ/mol (RB), -21.74 to -32.22 kJ/mol (ICB) and -26.27 to -33.11 (MCB) in temperature range 303-338 K."
"Sugar beet pulp (SBP) is a well known adsorbent, however the use of sugar beet pulp as an adsorbent for removal of cationic dyes was not reported in the literature, so far. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to study the effects of contact time, initial concentration (20–50 mg/L) and pH (2–8) on the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution by SBP. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models were found to be suitable for description of MB adsorption on SBP. The SBP was found to have a Langmuir monolayers adsorption capacity of 714.29 mg/g at pH 8 and 25 °C. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model best described the absorption process (R2 ≥ 0.9999). The extent of MB adsorption on SBP increased along with an increase of initial pH of the solution and initial MB concentration. The results demonstrated that the SBP is a promising adsorbent for removal of MB from aqueous solutions."
"In this report, the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto MnO2/CS nanocomposite material from aqueous solution is investigated. All the factors, which affect the adsorption, such as pH, adsorption time, Cr(VI) initial concentration and adsorbent dosage, are also examined. The results obtained show that the Cr(VI) uptake is strongly affected by pH and ion strength. Analysis within the nonlinear isotherm models indicates that the Sips isotherm combining with the Langmuir and Freundlich models offer the best fit to the experimental data due to the obtained highest R2 and smallest RMSE and χ2 values. The calculated Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity is 61.56 mg g−1 at pH of 2.0 and adsorption time of 120 min. Moreover, the mechanism studies by combining theoretical models with analytical spectroscopies reveal that the electrostatic attraction plays the important role to the uptake of Cr(VI) onto MnO2/CS nanocomposite. Therefore, the present nanocomposite material can be applied to remove total Cr from wastewater produced by the galvanized manufacturing factory with a relatively high efficiency."
"Isotherms of adsorption of Azraq humic acid (HA) onto Azraq bentonite were studied at different pH (3.0–6.0) and temperature values. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity (qm) was found to be 53 mg HA/g raw bentonite at pH = 3.0 and 25 °C, ΔH° = 54.8 kJ/mol, ΔS° = 220 J/mol deg which were approximate to those reported for the adsorption of HA on kaolinite. In the case of bentonite, the qm and Langmuir constant (KL) values are significantly greater than those reported for zeolite. These results indicate the importance of sheet structure of bentonite in the adsorption process. Treatment of raw bentonite with NaCl, CH3COOH and HCOOH does not affect adsorptivity (qm and KL) of HA on bentonite, while treatment with HCl causes great decrease in adsorptivity. The adsorptivity of HA on bentonite was found to be inversely proportional to the increase in pH because of the increase in repulsion between HA and bentonite."
"In this investigation, surface modified Caryota urens seeds were effectively combined by sulphuric acid alteration taken after by ultrasonic treatment keeping in mind the end goal to evacuate the Zn(II) ions from aqueous solution. The execution of the readied adsorbent was contrasted and the raw Caryota urens seeds (RCUS) and sulphuric acid modified Caryota urens seeds (SMCUS). The present adsorption prepare was very impacted by the measurement of adsorbent, time of contact and the temperature of the system. The expulsion of Zn(II) particles was expanded with measurement of adsorbent and time yet it was diminished with the temperature. The optimum conditions for the maximum removal of Zn(II) ions for an initial Zn(II) ion concentration of 25 mg L−1: pH of 5.0, adsorbent dosage of 10 g/L (RCUS), 4 g/L (SMCUS) and 2 g/L (UACUS), contact time of 120 min (RCUS), 90 min (SMCUS) and 60 min (UACUS) and temperature of 30 °C. The adsorption isotherm information was best obeyed with Freundlich show which prompts clarify the heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption of Zn(II) ions onto adsorbent. The anticipated Langmuir monolayer sorption capacity with respect to the tested adsorbent was of 80.91 mg g−1. The ascertained enthalpy and Gibb’s free energy for the contemplated framework was observed to be negative which shows exothermic and attainable adsorption handle. The explored Caryota urens seeds has a great adsorption potential for the expulsion of overwhelming metals from water/wastewater."
"An inexpensive and easily available Moroccan natural clay, called locally Ghassoul, was employed for adsorption of methyl violet, a cationic dye, in aqueous solution. The experiments were carried out in a batch system to optimize various experimental parameters such as pH, initial dye concentration, contact time, temperature and ionic strength. The experimental data can be well represented by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was estimated as 625 mg/g at 298. Kinetic analyses showed that the adsorption rates were more accurately represented by a pseudo second-order model. Intraparticle diffusion process was identified as the main mechanism controlling the rate of the dye sorption. In addition, various thermodynamic activation parameters, such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy and the activation energy were calculated. The adsorption process was found to be a spontaneous and endothermic process. The obtained results confirmed the applicability of this clay as an efficient and economical adsorbent for cationic dyes from contaminated water."
"The present investigation reports an effective adsorption of both cationic and anionic azo dyes by maize stem parenchymatous ground tissue with the vascular bundles embedded in it (MSGT), as novel, inexpensive and abundantly available alternative to the other commercial adsorbents. The feasibility of MSGT, for the adsorptive removal of both cationic (Methylene blue – MB) and anionic (Eriochrome black T – EBT) dyes from aqueous solution was evaluated in a batch process. Kinetic of dyes adsorption followed the pseudo second-order equation (R2 > 0.997). The equilibrium data of both MB and EBT adsorption were well correlated by both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm at initial dye concentration (20–50 mg/L) and pH (2–6) ranges studied. Maximum Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of MSGT was found to be 160.84 mg/g for MB at pH 6, and 167.01 mg/g for EBT at pH 2. This study developed mathematical models for the optimization of pH, contact time and initial dye concentration for the adsorption of MB and EBT onto MSGT. Experimental values of the adsorption capacity were in good agreement with the optimum values predicted by the models."
"The demand for clean water is on the increase as rapid industrialization is still contributing to pollution. Nowadays, as water is the basic need for mankind, efforts have gathered momentum to decontaminate it in order to address the acute shortage of clean and pure water. Maize tassel was used as the precursor for making activated carbon for the adsorption of Pb(II) ions. The product obtained was characterized and utilized for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions over a wide range of initial metal ion concentration (10–50 mg/L), contact time (5–300 min), adsorbent dose (0.1–2.5 g), and pH (2–12). The optimum set of conditions for biosorption of Pb(II) ion were found to be initial concentration 10 mg/L, dosage 1.2 g, and pH 5.4. The adsorption data conformed to both the Langmuir and the Freundlich isotherms but fitted best into the Langmuir model. The<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math>for Langmuir equation was 0.9997 and that for Freundlich was 0.9515. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the activated carbon was calculated to be 37.31 mg/g. The results indicate that activated carbon might be used to effectively adsorb Pb(II) ions from wastewater treatment plants."
"Two common clay minerals, kaolinite and montmorillonite, are activated by treating with 0.25 M H2SO4, and the effects of acid treatment are monitored with XRD and FTIR measurements and by measuring changes in surface area and the cation exchange capacity (CEC). Kaolinite, montmorillonite, and their acid-activated forms are used as adsorbents for removing Cd(II) from water in a batch process with variations in initial Cd(II) concentration, amount of clay, pH, time, and temperature. Different models of kinetics and isotherms are tested by the data-fitting procedure. Kaolinite is much inferior to montmorillonite with respect to Cd(II) adsorption, and acid activation enhances adsorption to different extents for the two clays. Langmuir monolayer capacity has the values of 9.9, 11.4, 32.7, and 33.2 mg g-1 for kaolinite, acid-activated kaolinite, montmorillonite, and acid-activated montmorillonite respectively. Adsorption follows an endothermic path with decrease in entropy and Gibbs energy."
"Adsorption of Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solution on kaolinite and montmorillonite, intercalated with zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl2·8H2O) is investigated in this work. The study is carried out under different environmental conditions obtained by varying pH, concentration of the metal ions, amount of adsorbent, interaction time and temperature. The adsorption is rapid with equilibrium approaching within 300 min for Fe(III), 240 min for Co(II) and 180 min for Ni(II). Second order kinetics gives a better explanation of the rate processes and ZrO–montmorillonite has a larger adsorption capacity than that of ZrO–kaolinite for all the metal ions. The Langmuir monolayer capacity also shows big differences between ZrO–kaolinite and ZrO–montmorillonite, the average values for ZrO–kaolinite and ZrO–montmorillonite being 9.7 and 23.8 mg g−1 with respect to Fe(III), 9.6 and 22.8 mg g−1 for Co(II), and 8.8 and 22.0 mg g−1 for Ni(II), respectively. ZrO–kaolinite interacts endothermically with Co(II) while all the other interactions are exothermic. The results have shown good potentiality for ZrO–clays to be used as adsorbents for Fe(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) ions in aqueous medium."
"The present work investigates the adsorptive behavior of As(V) ions with kaolinite, montmorillonite and illite in aqueous medium as a function of As(V) concentration, pH, contact time and temperature. As(V) adsorption on studied clays were pH dependent and maximum adsorption were achieved in the pH range 2.0-5.0. The adsorption data gave good fits with Langmuir isotherm and yielded Langmuir monolayer capacity of 0.86, 0.64 and 0.52 mg As(V) /g of kaolinite, montmorillonite and illite, respectively. An increase in adsorption temperature resulted in a decrease in the amount of As(V) adsorbed. The results of leaching study showed that, kaolinite was very active clay constituent regarding both As(V) adsorption and mobility. The electrokinetic behavior of both the kaolinite and montmorillonite were modified in the presence of As(V). The shift in isoelectric point indicated that adsorption involves inner sphere surface complexation and strong specific ion adsorption. Kaolinite was successfully tested as an adsorbent for the removal of arsenic from two contaminated groundwater samples containing arsenic in the range 1.36-1.41 mg/L."
"The studies of kinetics and equilibrium sorption of Cu(II) were undertaken using nanoscale zerovalent manganese (nZVMn) synthesized by chemical reduction in a single pot system. nZVMn was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray, and surface area determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller. The effect of pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, agitation speed, initial Cu(II) concentrations, temperature, and ionic strength on the sorption of Cu(II) onto nZVMn were investigated in a batch system. The kinetic data followed pseudo-second-order. The mechanism was governed by pore diffusion. The equilibrium sorption data were tested by Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Dubinin–Kaganer–Raduskevich, and Halsey isotherm models. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity (Qmax = 181.818 mg/g) is much greater compared to other nano-adsorbents used in sorption of Cu(II). The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH0, ΔS0, ΔG0) revealed a feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic adsorption process. nZVMn has a great potential for effective removal of copper (II) in aqueous solution."
"Clay of the Gulbarga region, Karnataka, India, containing montmorillonite was evaluated as an adsorbent for Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. Equilibrium studies at pH 2.5 for the adsorption of Cu(II) on the clay were performed and modeling of Cu(II) adsorption on the clay was carried out with various isotherms. The Langmuir model provided the best fit to the experimental data among the two-parameter isotherms. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity and the cation exchange capacity of the clay were found to be about 31 mg Cu(II)/g and 86 meq/100 g respectively. The Fritz–Schluender model provided the best fit to the data among the three-parameter models. A two-stage batch adsorber was designed for the removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions, which reduced the adsorbent dose by 51% when compared to that of a single-stage adsorption system."
"This paper presents the adsorption of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution on modified Unye bentonite. Adsorption of Cu(II) ions by magnesium oxide-coated bentonite (MCB) sample was investigated as a function of the initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature and inorganic ligands (Cl−, SO42−, and HPO42−). Changes in the surfaces and structure were characterized by means of XRD and N2 gas adsorption data. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of MCB in 0.1 M KNO3 solution was estimated as 58.44 mg/g. ΔG, ΔH and ΔS values were evaluated for MCB to be −9.50 kJ/mol (at 303 K), 43.81 kJ/mol and 175.85 J/mol K."
"Presence of dye molecules in water causes various harmful effects for both human and aquatic species. Herein, we tried to remove two cationic dyes, namely Crystal violet and Brilliant green, from water by kaolinite clay mineral. The kaolinite clay mineral is further treated with 0.25 M and 0.05 M H2SO4 to increase its adsorption capacity. The structural changes due to acid treatment were analyzed by XRD, zeta potential, FTIR, SEM, cation exchange capacity, BET surface area, and pore volume measurements. Kinetic data were analyzed by using five different kinetic models and the data fitted best to pseudo-second-order model. Langmuir isotherm showed best fit to the adsorption of both Crystal violet and Brilliant green. Acid–treatment has slightly increased the adsorption capacities for both the dyes. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of raw kaolinite was found to be 47.17 and 25.70 mg g−1 for Crystal violet and Brilliant green, respectively, which increased to 49.50 and 50.51 mg g−1 for 0.25 M and 0.50 M acid-treated kaolinite in case of Crystal violet and to 26.45 and 26.88 mg g−1 in case of Brilliant green at 303 K. Crystal violet adsorption was exothermic with increase in ∆G values, whereas Brilliant green adsorption was endothermic in nature with decrease in ∆G in the temperature range 293–323 K. Reusability study showed the adsorbents could be successfully used up to 3rd cycle without much loss of adsorption capacity."
"In this study we have synthesized a high surface area magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) impregnated with α-Fe2O3 for the removal of a toxic textile azodye Eriochrome Black T (EBT). MGO was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX), fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. Batch adsorption of EBT with MGO was studied using various isotherms and it was found to follow Langmuir monolayer adsorption with 210.53 mg g−1 maximum adsorption capacity. Thermodynamic study indicates the adsorption to be spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The time-dependent adsorption followed pseudosecond order kinetics and intraparticle diffusion model indicates strong initial adsorption and the diffusion is controlled by both boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion. Attempt was made to study the dynamic EBT adsorption, for which a customized filter was prepared. It was observed that MGO has high adsorption capacity in this case as well which led to the conclusion that MGO filters have a great potential to be used commercially, becoming a futuristic adsorbent."
"Kaolinite and montmorillonite were modified with tetrabutylammonium (TBA) bromide, followed by calcination. The structural changes were monitored with XRD, FTIR, surface area and cation exchange capacity measurements. The modified clay minerals were used for adsorption of Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution under different conditions of pH, time and temperature. The uptake of the metal ions took place by a second order kinetics. The modified montmorillonite had a higher adsorption capacity than the corresponding kaolinite. The Langmuir monolayer capacities for the modified kaolinite and montmorillonite were Fe(III): 9.3 mg g− 1 and 22.6 mg g− 1; Co(II): 9.0 mg g− 1 and 22.3 mg g− 1; and Ni(II): 8.4 mg g− 1 and 19.7 mg g− 1. The modified kaolinite interacted with Co(II) in an endothermic manner, but all the other interactions were exothermic. The decrease of the Gibbs energy in all the cases indicated spontaneous adsorption."
"Abstract Cashew nut shell (CNS) is an agricultural waste was investigated as a new adsorbent for the removal of zinc(II) from aqueous environment. Effects of solution pH, CNS dose, contact time, initial zinc(II) concentration and temperature on removal efficiency were tested and optimum conditions were evaluated. The equilibrium data were fitted well with Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of CNS was examined as 24.98 mg/g. Changes in standard Gibbs free energy (▵ G °), standard enthalpy (▵ H °) and standard entropy (▵ S °) showed that the sorption of zinc(II) ions onto CNS are spontaneous and exothermic at 303–333 K. Sorption process was found to be controlled by both surface and pore diffusion. A batch adsorber was designed for different CNS dose to effluent volume ratios using Langmuir equation. Effective diffusivity values were found to be 1.927 × 10 −11 (10 mg/L), 2.135 × 10 −11 (20 mg/L), 2.267 × 10 −11 (30 mg/L), 2.305 × 10 −11 (40 mg/L) and 2.362 × 10 −11 (50 mg/L) m 2 /s. © 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering"
"This study was undertaken to evaluate the adsorption potential of a naturally available, cost-effective, raw eucalyptus bark (EB) (Eucalyptus sheathiana) biomass, to remove organic methylene blue (MB) dye from its aqueous solutions. Effects of various process parameters such as initial dye concentration, adsorbent loading, solution pH, temperature, presence of salts, mixture of dyes and surfactant onto MB dye adsorption by bark material were studied. Significant effect on adsorption was witnessed on varying the pH of the MB solutions. Results showed that the optimum pH lies between 7.4 and 10.0. The extent (%) of MB adsorption from aqueous solution decreased with the increase in the initial MB dye concentration, but increased with rise in temperature. The extent of MB dye adsorption was found to be enhanced due to increase of salts concentration. This is because of salting-out-effect, which comprises the changes of various short range forces. The overall kinetic studies showed that the MB dye adsorption by EB biomass followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The mechanism of MB dye adsorption was analysed by intra-particle diffusion model and desorption study. Free energy change of adsorption (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) were calculated to predict the nature of adsorption. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model yields a better correlation coefficient than the Freundlich model and the dimensionless separation factor “RL” indicated favourable adsorption process. The maximum Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of raw EB for MB dye was found to be 204.08 mg/g at 30°C. A single-stage batch adsorber design for MB dye adsorption onto EB biomass has been presented based on the Langmuir isotherm model equation. The results obtained in this study suggest a promising future for inexpensive raw EB biomass as a novel adsorbent and a better alternative to activated carbon adsorbent used for the removal of MB dye from dye bearing effluents."
"Poly(trimesoyl chloride-melamine) was grafted on palygorskite via in situ interfacial polymerization. The poly(trimesoyl chloride-melamine)-grafted palygorskite (PTMP) composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), N2-physisorption, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The performance of PTMP as an adsorbent was evaluated for the removal of methylene blue dye (MB) in batch and column systems. The effects of initial dye concentration, contact time, temperature and initial pH on the efficiency of MB removal were investigated. A high adsorption efficiency (≈100%) was shown by PTMP removal within 8 min with high Langmuir monolayer capacity of 64.5 mg/g at 25 °C. The mechanisms of adsorption were evaluated by isotherm and kinetic models. The activation energy Ea and different thermodynamic parameters, for example, ΔGo, ΔSo, and ΔHo were calculated. The prepared composite demonstrated to be an efficient adsorbent for simultaneous removal of dye and toxic metals such as As(III), Cr(III), Mo(II), Co(III), Ni(II), and Hg(II). The dye removal was evaluated by a packed bed column system and showed an excellent adsorption performance with 90 min breakthrough at 160 ppm of initial dye concentration."
"Zn(II) adsorption from aqueous solution on alkaline Ca-bentonite (ACB) was studied using batch technique and compared with the adsorption onto raw bentonite (RB). The percentage of Zn(II) removal increased with increasing adsorbent dosage, contact time and pH. The optimum initial pH for Zn(II) removal by RB and ACB was 7.0 and 4.0–7.0, respectively. The adsorption data from both RB and ACB experiments could be well-described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The experimental data for Zn(II) adsorption on RB could be described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms while those on ACB could be fit well to the Langmuir isotherm. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of ACB (149 mg g− 1) was found to be roughly two times greater than that of RB (73.5 mg g− 1). Therefore, ACB is more effective than RB for Zn(II) adsorption from aqueous solution with respect to short equilibrium time, high efficiency and broad pH range. The equilibrium data, SEM and XRD analyses indicate that ACB removes Zn(II) from aqueous solution mainly by surface precipitation, cation exchange and fixation. In summary, the study suggests that ACB is very suitable for potential applications in Zn(II) removal from aqueous solution."
"This paper presents the synthesis, structural characterization and Pb(II) adsorption behavior of K-birnessite and H-birnessite samples. Changes in the surfaces and structure of birnessite samples were characterized by means of infrared spectroscopy (IR), N2 gas adsorption and thermal analysis (TG–DTA) techniques. Adsorption of Pb(II) by samples was investigated as a function of the initial Pb(II) concentration, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature and inorganic ligand (NO3−, Cl−). The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of K-birnessite and H-birnessite samples in 0.1 M NaNO3 solution at 298 K were estimated as 164.30 and 133.17 mg/g, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as change in free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) were evaluated for K-birnessite and H-birnessite to be −22.43 kJ/mol (at 298 K), 23.90 kJ/mol, 155 J/mol K, and −18.50 kJ/mol (at 298 K), 10.57 kJ/mol, 98 J/mol K, respectively."
"Isotherms of adsorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) onto solid Azraq humic acid (AZHA) were studied at different pH (2.0-3.7) values and 0.1 M NaClO4 ionic strength. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was found to range from 0.1 to 1.0 mmol metal ion/g AZHA, where Cu(II) has higher adsorptivity than Ni(II). The previously reported NICA-Donnan parameters for sorption of Cu(II) on HA fit the amount of Cu(bound) determined in the present study at pH 3.7 but underestimates those at pH values of 3.0, 2.4, and 2.0. The contribution of low affinity sites to binding of metal ions increases with decreasing pH and increasing metal ion loading. The aggregation of HA, which is facilitated by decreasing pH and increasing metal loading, may increase the ability of low-affinity sites to encapsulate metal ions. The binding of Ni(II) to HA exhibits less heterogeneity and less multidentism than that of Cu(II). AZHA loaded with Cu(II) and Ni(II) was found to be insoluble in water with no measurable amount of desorbed metal ions."
"Synthesis of nanoscale zerovalent manganese (nZVMn) by chemical reduction was carried out in a single pot system under inert environment. nZVMn was characterized using a combination of analytical techniques: Ultraviolet–Visible Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray, BET surface area and Point of Zero Charge. The adsorption physicochemical factors: pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, agitation speed, initial copper ion concentration and temperature were optimized. The kinetic data fitted better to Pseudo second-order, Elovich, fractional power and intraparticle diffusion models and their validity was tested by three statistical models: sum of square error, Chi-square (χ 2) and normalized standard deviation (Δq). Seven of the two-parameter isotherm models [Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Dubinin–Kaganer–Raduskevich (DKR), Halsey, Harkin–Jura and Flory–Huggins] were used to analyse the equilibrium adsorption data. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity (Q max = 181.818 mg/g) obtained is greater than other those of nano-adsorbents utilized in adsorption of copper ions. The equilibrium adsorption data were better described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, DKR and Halsey isotherm models considering their coefficient of regression (R 2 > 0.90). The values of the thermodynamic parameters: standard enthalpy change ∆H° (+50.27848 kJ mol−1), standard entropy change ∆S° (203.5724 J mol−1 K−1) and the Gibbs free energy change ∆G° revealed that the adsorption process was feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic in nature. The performance of this novel nanoscale zerovalent manganese (nZVMn) suggested that it has a great potential for effective removal of copper ions from aqueous solution."
"In this study, adsorption of Cu(II) onto the five locally abundantly low-cost biosorbents (Laminaria japonica, P. yezoensis Ueda, rice bran, wheat bran and walnut hull) was investigated depending on initial solution pH, contact time, adsorbent concentration and reaction temperature. Cu(II) removal was pH-dependent for various biosorbents investigated. For P. yezoensis Ueda, rice bran, wheat bran and walnut hull, the batch equilibrium data were correlated to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and the data fitted better to the Langmuir isotherm equation and yielded Langmuir monolayer capacity of 5.04, 10.41, 6.85 and 3.52 mg/g at the temperature of 20°C, respectively. In the case of Laminaria japonica, the equilibrium data obeyed the Hill-der Boer equation for the whole initial concentration ranges of 0–200 mg/L examined, but only to Langmuir and Freundlich equations for the initial concentration less than 120 mg/L at various temperatures. The apparent thermodynamic parameters were calculated for each of the five biosorbents (ΔH = 9.25–40.04 kJ/mol; ΔG = –17.60 to –24.16 kJ/mol and ΔS = 85.81–228 J/mol K). The numerical values obtained showed that Cu(II) adsorption is a spontaneous, entropy-driven and endothermic process. The batch kinetic data were correlated to the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models and the data fitted better to the pseudo-second order equation (the pseudo-second order rate constants, k2,e = 0.1059–0.9453 g/(mg min); the correlation coefficients, r = 0.9816–0.9993)."
"Hydrous Ce(IV)–Zr(IV) oxide (Ce/Zr ∼ 1:1, mol/mol) (HCZMO) prepared by simple chemical precipitation was nanoparticles (60–70 nm) agglomerate with irregular surface morphology. The BET surface area, pore volume and pHzpc were estimated to be 185.04 m2 g−1, 0.1219 cm3 g−1 and 5.8 (±0.2), respectively. Investigation of fluoride adsorption over HCZMO from its aqueous phase at an optimized pH ∼ 6.0 showed that the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium data described, respectively, the pseudo-second order equation (R2 = 0.98–0.99) and the Langmuir isotherm (R2 > 0.99) very well. Values of the computed Arrhenius activation energy, Ea (1.16 kJ mol−1), Langmuir monolayer capacity, θ (19.5 mg g−1), D–R adsorption energy, ED–R (15.05 kJ mol−1) and isosteric heat of reaction, ΔHr (0.518 kJ mol−1) suggested that the fluoride has high affinity for homogeneous HCZMO surface for adsorption. Evidences appeared from the equal distribution co-efficient values and too well Langmuir isotherm fit. The fluoride adsorption reactions at 298–313 K with HCZMO were spontaneous (ΔG0 = negative) despite endothermic nature (ΔH0, kJ mol−1 = +3.53, +4.04), owing to the increase of entropy (ΔS0, J mol−1 K−1 = +12.4, 13.8). More than 95% fluoride was released from F−HCZMO (24.8 mg F− g−1) by 1.0 M NaOH, confirming the ion-exchange adsorption mechanism inclining to chemisorption. 1 g HCZMO per liter of a groundwater (F−: 4.40 mg L−1) can reduce fluoride level below 1.5 mg L−1 in batch treatment."
"This paper reports zirconium oxide-coated sand preparation, characterization by SEM, EDX, XRD, FT-IR and thermoanalytical techniques, and use as an adsorbent for the removal of most toxic form of arsenic, As(III), from aqueous solution in both batch and column methods. Batch experimental parameters such as contact time, concentration, dose of adsorbent, pH of As(III) solution and temperature were optimized. The adsorption data was fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms at 303, 308 and 313 K. The maximum Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was found to be 136.98 μg/g at 313 K. Values of ΔH°, ΔG° and ΔS° were found to be −12.90, −8.74 to –8.28 and 0.014 kJ/mol, suggesting exothermic and spontaneous adsorption process with slight increase in entropy. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second order kinetics and was controlled by film diffusion step. The column studies showed that when flow rate was increased from 3.0 to 5.0 mL/min, the arsenic adsorption capacity of ZrOCS increased from 33.104 to 42.231 μg/g and breakthrough, and exhaustion times got reduced reduced. The results indicated that zirconium oxide-coated sand (ZrOCS) is an excellent adsorbent for the removal of As(III) from water."
"Toxic methylene blue dye is removed from water by accumulating it on the surface of clay minerals. Clay adsorbents are obtained from kaolinite, montmorillonite, and their acid activated forms. The adsorption experiments are carried out in a batch process in environments of different pH, initial dye concentration, amount of clay, interaction time, and temperature. Adsorption of dye is best described by second order kinetics. In the temperature range of 303 to 333 K, the Langmuir monolayer capacity for three kaolinite species increased from 45.5 to 56.5 mg g−1, 45.9 to 57.8 mg g−1, 46.3 to 58.8 mg g−1, and for three montmorillonites species from 163.9 to 181.8 mg g−1, 166.7 to 188.8 mg g−1, and 172.4 to 192.3 mg g−1. The interaction is an endothermic process driven by entropy increase and spontaneous adsorptive accumulation is ensured by favorable Gibbs energy decrease. It is found that acid activation enhances the adsorption capacity of kaolinite and montmorillonite."
"In this research, a high resistant bacterium for chromium was cultured from effluent of a sustenance industrial process in the Vellore city, India. The resistant strain was observed to be Pseudomonas stutzeri after 16S rRNA gene sequencing. BLAST examination demonstrated the succession comparability about the bacterial isolate. Different MICs was seen against various antibiotics and numerous anti-microbial resistance of the isolated strain was resolved. Bioinformatics studies using I-TASSER showed the structure and folded nature of the predicted protein. Metal binding site was also determined using I-TASSER tool. FT-IR exhibited the alcoholic hydroxyl groups, amino, and amide groups attached with metal ion particles. The mixture of sulphuric acid treated Banyan tree bark and Pseudomonas stutzeri was utilized as a biosorbent for the elimination of Cr(VI) ions. The biosorption process was optimized to recover the maximum amount of Cr(VI) ions from the aquatic system. The adsorption kinetics was systemized using Pseudo-first order kinetic model. Adsorption equilibrium data was best exhibited the results for Freundlich model. Langmuir monolayer capacity was noted to be 27.47 mg/g. The present biosorbent showed excellent biosorbent potential for Cr(VI) ions and this material can be utilized for the treatment of industrial wastewater."
"Adsorption reactions of Cd(II) and Cu(II) with nanoparticle agglomerates of titanium(IV) oxide (NHTO) were investigated from single and bi-component systems at optimized pH 5.0. Kinetic data of metal ion removal reactions described the pseudo-second order equation very well. Both Langmuir and Redlich–Peterson models described the equilibrium data well (R2 > 0.95). Values of the monolayer adsorption capacities (mg·g− 1) of Cd(II) (49.50 to 60.24) and Cu(II) (42.02 to 52.63) were high, and that increased with increasing temperature on the reactions. Thermodynamic analyses of the equilibrium data suggested that the removal reactions were spontaneous [−∆G0, kJ·mol− 1 = 24.31 to 32.73 for Cd(II); and 19.62 to 27.38 for Cu(II)]. Spontaneity of the reactions increased with increasing temperature. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of either Cd(II) or Cu(II) was less in presence of each other than that of single component systems. The mean adsorption energy estimation suggested that the interaction between either of the metal ions with NHTO was columbic type. About 71 to 75% of adsorbed metal ions could be recovered as the metal oxide from their solutions, which were obtained by the desorption reaction with 0.1 M HCl."
"The present investigation reports an effective adsorption of methyl orange dye using the leaves of populous tree in five different forms. The physicochemical properties of all adsorbents were characterized using instrumental analyses such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The feasibility of populous leaves for the adsorptive removal of methyl orange dye from aqueous solution was evaluated in a batch process by varying operational parameters such as adsorbent dosage (0.2–0.6 g), solution pH 3–12, initial dye concentration (5–100 ppm), and contact time (10–100 min). The equilibrium data was correlated by both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. The maximum Langmuir monolayer adsorptive capacity was found to be 90.44 mg/g at pH 3.0 and 303.15 K with coefficient of determination R2 = 0.9988 for L-arginine treated populous charcoal powder. The kinetic study revealed that the system obeyed pseudo-first order kinetic model for all the adsorbents (R2 > 0.93). The thermodynamic adsorption parameters showed that the adsorption process is exothermic. Using quadrate models and optimizing the conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity for all the adsorbents was observed at initial dye concentration (75 ppm), dosage of adsorbents (0.6 g) and pH (5). The computational chemistry was also used to validate the adsorption of methyl orange dye."
"Intercalation of montmorillonite by tetramethylammonium cations significantly increases the basal spacing, surface functionality, surface area, and thermal stability, leading to a significant enhancement in Cu(<sc>ii</sc>) Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity (925.93 mg g<sup>−1</sup>)."
"Macadamia activated carbon (MAC) was impregnated with different concentrations of sulphuric or phosphoric or nitric acid ranging from 20 to 60% v/v and heated in a muffle furnace to improve the structural characteristics of the adsorbents for enhanced Cr(VI) removal. The %S content ranging between 2.27 and 3.23% in H2SO4 treated MAC corroborated the incorporation of sulphonate groups during modification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy displayed presence of CN, NO, sulphur and phosphorus peaks at 1213, 1531, 1204, and 1214 cm−1, respectively, proving efficacious attachment of the functional groups because of acid treatments. The surface area of pristine MAC increased from 545 to 824 m2/g following acid treatment. The optimum performance for the adsorption of Cr(VI) was 98% at pH 1 and 93% at pH 4 after 120 min of contact time. Compared to pristine carbons (22.3 mg/g), there was an improvement in adsorption capacity to 40.99 mg/g when 20% (v/v) HNO3 activating agent was used, but the adsorption capacity dropped to 9.66 mg/g when 20% (v/v) H2SO4 was used. Materials modified with HNO3 and H3PO4 exhibited superior performances to H2SO4 modified adsorbents indicating the importance of evaluating various concentrations and type of acid as these had positive and negative effects on Cr(VI) removal. The removal mechanism was better explained by both the Langmuir monolayer and Freundlich multilayer isotherms."
"A new 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH-560) cross-linked graphene oxide/chitosan (GO/CS) composite aerogel was synthesized by sol-gel and freeze-drying methods. In this study, the three-dimensional porous network structure of composite aerogel was established by the self-assemble interaction between CS and GO, and by the crosslinking reaction between CS and KH-560. GO could enhance the strength of aerogels and keep porous structure stable, and KH-560 was used to avoid the dissolution of CS in acid conditions. The chemical properties, microstructure and thermal properties were investigated by FTIR, XPS, SEM, and TGA. The adsorption performance of composite aerogel was also studied. The results indicated that the process followed the Langmuir monolayer adsorption and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption could reach equilibrium within 120 min, and the maximum adsorption capacity could reach up to 146 mg g −1 ; the aerogel adsorbent showed the good reusability and high adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) in coexistence with other ions."
"Locally available natural waste such as cashew nut shell ( CNS ), a byproduct of cashew nut industry, was found to be a low‐cost material and also a promising adsorbent for removing lead( II ) ions from simulated wastewater. A batch adsorption study was carried out with various adsorption parameters, such as solution pH , CNS dose, contact time, initial lead( II ) ion concentration, and temperature. The kinetic data were analyzed using four adsorption kinetic models: the pseudo‐first‐order and pseudo‐second‐order equations, intraparticle diffusion, and Boyd kinetic equation to determine the best fit equation for the adsorption of lead( II ) ions onto CNS . Kinetics of lead( II ) ions adsorption by CNS is better described by the pseudo‐second‐order equation. Various thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°, have also been evaluated and it has been found that the adsorption process was feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic in nature. The experimental data were analyzed using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption isotherm equations. The equilibrium data were found to fit well in the Freundlich isotherm, which confirmed the multilayer coverage of lead( II ) ions onto CNS . The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the CNS was found to be 17.82 mg/g. A single‐state batch adsorber system was designed to estimate the amount of adsorbent required to treat the known volume of the effluent using the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The results indicate that the CNS can be used to effectively adsorb lead( II ) from wastewater. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 55–64, 2014"
"Herein, we report the synthesis of Mg/Al-CO3 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) by the urea hydrolysis method under hydrothermal conditions at different aging times. The LDHs were characterized by different microscopic, spectroscopic, diffractometric, and thermal analysis techniques. The as-prepared LDHs were then used as adsorbents for the removal of fluoride ions from water. The adsorption process was systematically studied in terms of influences of pH, interaction time, temperature, adsorbent loading, fluoride ion concentration, and the effect of coexisting anions to understand the ideal conditions for adsorption. The adsorption process primarily followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of different adsorbents are in the range of 15.13–27.03 mg g–1 at 303 K. The hydrothermal aging time has a negative impact on the adsorption capacities of the LDHs. The as-prepared LDHs are reusable up to five cycles of the fluoride ion adsorption–desorption process."
"In this work the properties of two ternary sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol monolayers imitating erythrocyte membrane were studied at various content of sterol. Phosphatidylcholines chosen for experiments differ in the length of sn-1 saturated chain in the molecule (1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-SOPC vs. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine - POPC). Langmuir monolayer experiments combined with Brewster Angle Microscopy prove that for both investigated systems the most favorable effect of cholesterol appears at 30% of sterol in the film. However, the interactions between molecules at 50% of sterol are only slightly weaker as compared to those for 1:1:1 films. It was also found that only at higher sterol concentration appear differences in the ordering effect of cholesterol on the systems containing PC molecules of various length of sn-1 saturated chain. Although the differences in the properties of POPC versus SOPC-containing monolayers were found, similarities in the morphology of the respective systems and stoichiometry of thermodynamically the most favorable mixture allow one to conclude that both SM/POPC/Chol as well as SM/SOPC/Chol monolayer can be used to mimic raft systems."
"Traditionally Langmuir monolayers and lipids bilayers (including cell membranes) on water interfaces are made of amphiphilic molecules with both polar hydrophilic and non-polar hydrophobic parts. It has been discovered that non-polar hydrocarbon chain molecules without the polar hydrophilic part, form Langmuir monolayers on water when the chain molecule has more than 30 carbon atoms, and form multilayers on water when the chain molecule has 30 or fewer carbon atoms. Here we report the surface pressure vs. area isotherm measurements of the H(CH2)29H film on water, which show the film’s maximum compression modulus (greatest resistance to lateral compression) at about 19 Å2/molecule, independent of the compression rate, like the Langmuir monolayers of long chain saturated fatty acids do. The cross-section area of the hydrocarbon chain is about 19 Å2. Our measurements indicate the formation of a Langmuir monolayer by H(CH2)29H, a non-polar hydrocarbon chain molecule with fewer than 30 carbon atoms. The mechanical properties of this new Langmuir monolayer are compared with the known Langmuir monolayers of the chain molecules with more than 30 carbon atoms."
"The Langmuir isotherm of copper (II) tetra-(tert-butyl)-5,10,15,20-tetraazaporphyrin [CuPaz(t-Bu)4] has been investigated at the air–water interface. The Langmuir monolayer displays two phase regions, which have a phase transition at 7 mN/m. Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films have been fabricated onto glass slides, interdigitated electrodes and quartz crystal microbalance electrodes, and characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, electrical and nanogravimetric measurements, respectively. The CuPaz(t-Bu)4 LB films were used to quantity some of the volatile gases, i.e. vapors of hexane, benzene and toluene. UV-VIS spectroscopic measurements reveal that there is an interaction between CuPaz(t-Bu)4 molecules and the above organic solvent molecules, which is manifested by a red shift and broadening of Soret and Q bands. The response and recovery behaviors, sensitivity and selectivity of the LB films to different organic vapors have been investigated by means of nanogravimetric measurements. Such results offer a potential application of such a porphyrin derivative for the detection of aromatic compounds, even at room temperature."
"This work is a review of the effect of different monovalent anions (belonging to the Hofmeister series) on a single model amphiphile, phosphatidylcholine molecules in contact with water, in three different geometries, Langmuir monolayers, bilayers and micelles, which differ by area per molecule and radius of curvature. The zwitterionic lipids DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine) and DPC (Dodecylphosphocholine) have been used to form the three geometries. The salt solutions used were NaCl, NaBr, NaNO3, NaI, NaBF4, NaClO4 and NaSCN. Various interfacial and bulk experimental techniques were used in order to study the effect of the anions on the amphiphiles in the three geometries. The interfacial techniques used were surface pressure–area isotherms, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). The bulk sensitive techniques used were small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), osmotic stress (OS) and light scattering. The experimental results obtained from the three model systems indicate that the interfaces become charged through lipid-ion association. The results were fitted with appropriate theoretical models to provide "binding" or "partitioning" constants of anions in the headgroup region of the lipid molecules. The theoretical analysis strongly suggests that the anions do not associate with the lipid molecules through a local chemical reaction, but rather they partition inside the disordered lipid interfaces."
"In the recent past the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, vitamin E, and their derivatives have been extensively studied, particularly for their peculiar activity as radical scavengers. Furthermore, the association of vitamin C with vitamin E shows an interesting synergic effect in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fatty compounds such as linoleic acid, with vitamin C acting as a protective shield for vitamin E in solution against oxidizing agents. Vitamin C derivatives, such as its alkanoyl-6-O-ascorbic acid esters, act even better than ascorbic acid itself, because they possess the amphiphilic structure that allows the molecule to enter the hydrophobic region of a micelle or of a liposome. In order to deepen the understanding of the vitamin C/vitamin E mixed system and of the role played by ascorbic acid in restoring tocopherols, the miscibility properties of ascorbic acid derivatives and of tocopherols need to be studied in all states of aggregation (Langmuir monolayers, micellar dispersions, vesicles). In this paper we report a detailed study of the properties and behavior of monomolecular films of stearoyl-6-O-ascorbic acid (ascorbyl stearate), and α-(±)-tocopherol at different temperatures and pH, and of their mixtures at 20 °C at the gas/water interface. Our results show that ascorbyl stearate produces monolayers with both liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed phases, while α-tocopherol films are in the liquid-expanded phase only. The two pure components are completely miscible at the gas/water interface in all ratios, and indicate the presence of repulsive interactions between the hydrocarbon chains of the surfactants."
"Abstract The technique of fluorescence microscopy enables imaging of coexisting domains in Langmuir monolayers which have been doped with a small amount of a fluorescent probe. It is also possible to image surface aggregates formed by labeled proteins interacting with phosholipid monolayers. The method has provided information concerning phase behavior and structure of monolayers and proven useful in the study of monolayers as model systems of membrance processes. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."
"Phosphate remediation is important for preventing eutrophication in fresh waters and maintaining water quality. One approach for phosphate removal involves the utilization of molecular receptors. However, our understanding of anion recognition in aqueous solution and at aqueous interfaces is underdeveloped, and the rational design of surface-immobilized receptors is still largely unexplored. Herein, we evaluated the driving forces controlling phosphate binding to elementary amphiphilic receptors anchored at air-water interfaces. We designed biologically inspired receptors with neutral thiourea, positively charged guanidinium, and thiouronium units that all formed Langmuir monolayers. Phosphate binding was quantitatively examined using surface pressure-area isotherms and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). The receptors within this homologous series differ in functional group, charge, and number of alkyl chains to help distinguish the fundamental components influencing anion recognition at aqueous interfaces. The two charged receptors bearing two alkyl chains each displayed strong phosphate affinities and 103- and 101-fold anti-Hofmeister selectivity over chloride, respectively. Neutral thiourea and the single-chain guanidinium receptor did not bind phosphate, revealing the importance of electrostatic interactions and supramolecular organization. Consistently, charge screening at high ionic strength weakens binding. Spectroscopic results confirmed phosphate binding to the double alkyl chain guanidinium receptor, whereas surface pressure isotherm results alone showed a minimal change, thus emphasizing the importance of interfacial spectroscopy. We found that the binding site identity, charged interface created by the electrical double layer, and supramolecular superstructure all affect interfacial binding. These detailed insights into phosphate recognition at aqueous interfaces provide a foundation to develop efficient receptors for phosphate capture."
"Inverted phase-contrast microscopy has been successfully used to observe in situ the growth of hydroxyapatite (HAp) from pseudophysiological solution under dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayer. The results showed that the DPPC monolayer template could control the sizes, orientation and morphology of the formed HAp crystals effectively. The HAp spherical particles with the diameters of 0.4–0.8 μm were formed beneath the DPPC monolayer after 7 days. The structure and component of HAp were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and electronprobe microanalyzer. The HAp crystallization process is controlled predominantly by electrostatic interactions between the template and HAp."

"In the present study, a novel activated carbon was prepared from low-cost eucalyptus seeds, which was utilised for the effectively removal of toxic zinc from the water/wastewater. The prepared adsorbent was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopic characterisation studies. Adsorption process was experimentally performed for optimising the influencing factors such as adsorbent dosage, solution pH, contact time, initial zinc concentration, and temperature for the maximum removal of zinc from aqueous solution. Adsorption isotherm of zinc removal was ensued Freundlich model, and the kinetic model ensued pseudo-second order model. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for zinc removal was evaluated as 80.37 mg/g. The results of the thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption process was exothermic, thermodynamically feasible and impulsive process. Finally, a batch adsorber was planned to remove zinc from known volume and known concentration of wastewater using best obeyed model such as Freundlich. The experimental details showed the newly prepared material can be effectively utilised as a cheap material for the adsorption of toxic metal ions from the contaminated water."

"In this paper, systematic studies concerning the influence of selected oxysterols on the structure and fluidity of human erythrocyte membrane modeled as Langmuir monolayers have been performed. Three oxidized cholesterol derivatives, namely 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OH) 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OH) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-K) have been incorporated in two different proportions (10 and 50%) into artificial erythrocyte membrane, modeled as two-component (cholesterol:POPC) Langmuir monolayer. All the studied oxysterols were found to alter membrane fluidity and the effect was more pronounced for higher oxysterol content. 7α-OH increased membrane fluidity while opposite effect was observed for 7β-OH and 7-K. Experiments performed on model systems have been verified in biological studies on red blood cells (RBC). Consistent results have been found, i.e. under the influence of 7α-OH, the elasticity of erythrocytes increased, and in the presence of other investigated oxysterols - decreased. The strongest effect was noticed for 7-K. Change of membrane elasticity was associated with the change of erythrocytes shape, being most noticeable under the influence of 7-K."
"We report isotherm and atomic force microscopy studies of collapsed Langmuir monolayers of fatty acids. The Langmuir monolayers were overcompressed in the range 7–40 °C and transferred onto mica after the sharp pressure drop when the collapse pressure was reached. Collapsed material was observed by AFM, which revealed that the multilayers are indeed three-dimensional crystallites. We found that the shape of the crystallites depends on the collapse temperature, the phase from which the collapse occurs and/or the chain length. However, at higher temperatures the collapsed films no longer show a well defined crystallite formation, but rather a more heterogeneous melt-like pattern. We associated the crystallite formation with known bulk crystal phases of the fatty acids."
"Understanding the molecular packing of glycerol monoesters at the air-water interface is relevant for various industries where their emulsifying characteristics are exploited. In this study, we show that glycerol monostearate (GMS) forms closely packed Langmuir monolayers, with an area per molecule of 19A² inferred from the surface pressure isotherms, similar to the value for stearic acid. The order parameter calculated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicates that the closely packed GMS molecules are fully connected by hydrogen bonding, which is important for applications as emulsifier. The GMS monolayer had a compressional modulus typical of a liquid-expanded (LE) phase at low surface pressures (<30mNm⁻¹), and of a liquid-condensed (LC) phase at higher pressures. The LE-LC phase transition was captured with Brewster angle microscopy images. Using in situ infrared measurements, we observed that the GMS chains were progressively organized with increasing surface pressure in the monolayer, again consistent with MD simulations. The importance of the chain size was confirmed in subsidiary experiments, in which glycerol monocaprylate did not form stable monolayers owing to its shorter chain. In summary, the combination of surface-specific methods to characterize Langmuir monolayers and MD simulations could illustrate the relevance of physicochemical properties of GMS for its emulsifying characteristics."
"Osseointegration between the surface of a certain material and the host tissue helps to evaluate the potential use of biomaterials in bone replacement. The physicochemical properties and biochemical composition of the material's surface regulates osseointegration. This study investigates how collagen into biomimetic matrixes affects hydroxyapatite (HAp) growth. Collagen was inserted into insoluble Langmuir monolayers containing either 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA) and transferred to titanium (Ti) supports by means of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The resulting films served as matrixes for HAp growth upon exposure of Ti discs to SBF. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy in the infrared region, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy aided characterization of the samples. Properties such as wettability, roughness, and surface free energy were also studied. The biocompatibility of the samples was investigated by osteoblast viability assays in vitro. Collagen interacted with DPPC and OPA at the air/water interface as evidenced by the pressure surface isotherms and the compressional modulus. Moreover, collagen in the subphase increased the stability of the phospholipid monolayer at high organization degree. Collagen incorporation into DPPC LB films induced formation of biomimetic HAp nanoparticles that resembled the HAp nanoparticles found in natural bone. Enhanced cell proliferation on the modified-Ti surfaces demonstrated that the coatings were not toxic to osteoblasts. These materials are potential candidates for bone-replacement applications."
"Asphaltenes have been suggested to play an important role in the remarkable stability of some water-in-crude oil emulsions, although the precise mechanisms by which they act are not yet fully understood. Being one of the more polar fractions in crude oils, asphaltenes are surface active and strongly adsorb at the oil/water interface, and as the interface becomes densely packed, solid-like mechanical properties emerge, which influence many typical interfacial experiments. The present work focuses on purposefully measuring the rheology in the limit of an insoluble, spread Langmuir monolayer in the absence of adsorption/desorption phenomena. Moreover, the changes in surface tension are deconvoluted from the purely mechanical contribution to the surface stress by experiments with precise interfacial kinematics. Compression "isotherms" are combined with the measurement of both shear and dilatational rheological properties to evaluate the relative contributions of mechanical versus thermodynamic aspects, i.e., to evaluate the "interfacial rheological" versus the standard interfacial activity. The experimental results suggest that asphaltene nanoaggregates are not very efficient in lowering interfacial tension but rather impart significant mechanical stresses. Interestingly, physical aging effects are not observed in the spread layers, contrary to results for adsorbed layers. By further studying asphaltene fractions of different polarity, we investigate whether mere packing effects or strong interactions determine the mechanical response of the dense asphaltene systems as either soft glassy or gel-like responses have been reported. The compressional and rheological data reflect the dense packing, and the behavior is captured well by the soft glassy rheology model, but a more complicated multilayer structure may develop as coverage is increased. Potential implications of the experimental observations on these model and insoluble interfaces for water-in-crude oil emulsion stability are briefly discussed."
"We report on the formation of stable and uniformly transferable Langmuir monolayers of a methacrylic homopolymer of Disperse Red-13 (HPDR13). There was no need of covalently attaching long alkyl side chains or mixing the homopolymer with film forming materials. HPDR13 was derived from DR13-methacrylate by a homo polymerization reaction in the presence of 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. Surface pressure isotherms were obtained under various subphase temperatures, pH conditions and at several compression speeds. The monolayer has also been characterized by surface potential isotherms. The results indicated that, in contrast to the poor stability of a methacrylate-DR13 monomer monolayer, stable monolayers of HPDR13 could be obtained at the air–water interface. A uniform layer by layer transfer has been demonstrated by the linear increase of maximum absorption with increasing film thickness. A red shift observed in the UV–Vis spectra of the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films revealed a possible J-type aggregation of molecules. LB films have also been characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy."
"Successive depositions of precompressed Langmuir monolayers have been shown to allow reproducible formation of air-stable, lipid−alkylsiloxane hybrid bimolecular architectures at oxidic supports. Specifically, prepolymerized Langmuir−Blodgett films of n-octadecylsiloxane (OTS) monolayers on oxided silicon substrates were used as the hydrophobic templates, upon which compressed monolayers of dipalmitoyl-sn1-glycerophosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and monosialogangliosides (Gm1) were deposited from a low-temperature air−water interface by the horizontal deposition method. Structural features of each leaflet of the resultant bimolecular architectures, namely DPPC/OTS/SiO2/Si and Gm1/OTS/SiO2/Si, were characterized using a combined application of infrared spectroscopy, null-ellipsometry, and surface wetting measurements. In both cases, the outer lipid leaflet (DPPC or Gm1) was found to be structurally decoupled with respect to the inner OTS layer. The inner silane layer was composed of essentially untilted (cant angle, θ = 0−10°), all-trans chains at the dense packing of ∼19 Å2/molecule, consistent with the previously reported structure in solution-phase assembled OTS monolayers. The outer DPPC leaflet, however, was found to be composed of collectively tilted (θ = 36°), all-trans acyl chains at the lower chain-packing density (∼26−28 Å2/chain) whereas the outer Gm1 leaflet was concluded to have essentially untilted chains at similarly lower chain-packing densities (∼23−26 Å2/chain) but with the carbohydrate head-groups disposed in a topologically staggered conformation. The structural independence of the two leaflets in the two classes of bilayered architectures examined here confirms the possibility of independently manipulating the molecular structure in each leaflet of supported hybrid bilayers."
"Ascorbyl palmitate (ASC(16)) is a molecule of potential pharmacological interest due to its antioxidant properties and amphiphilic nature. The surface behavior of ASC(16) was studied using Langmuir monolayers and Brewster angle microscopy. This molecule formed stable monolayers at room temperature that showed phase transition from a liquid-expanded to liquid-condensed or crystalline phase, depending on the subphase conditions. Using a theoretical approach, we were able to explain the behavior of the ASC(16) film at different bulk pH values and salt conditions based on the surface pH and the dissociation fraction of the film. Both condensed phases corresponded to highly packed conditions with the crystalline phase occurring at a low charge density, showing molecular tilting and preferential growth at characteristic angles, while the liquid-condensed phase formed in highly charged surfaces revealed small flowerlike domains probably as a consequence of internal dipole repulsion. A smaller perpendicular dipole moment was observed for the crystalline than the liquid-condensed phase which may explain the domain features. In conclusion, ASC(16) showed a complex surface behavior that was highly sensitive to subphase conditions."

"The ability of some hybrid xerogels (HyXs) to adsorb phenolic compounds from aqueous media was studied. It was shown that by incorporating n-alkylormosils (30–50%, v/v) into the composition of the HyXs the ability to adsorb phenolic compounds was improved. Aging of the HyXs was also shown to have an effect on the adsorptive capacity. Sol–gels dried at room temperature had higher adsorptive capacity compared with the analogous gels aged at 4 °C. All HyXs with an ormosil content between 0 and 80% exhibited a base reaction with the phenolic substances. It was also shown that hydrogen bonding appeared to have a negligible effect on the adsorption of the selected phenolic substances for the HyXs studied. It is proposed that adsorption occurs as a result of non-ionic but strong intermolecular Van der Waals interactions and as a consequence is geometry and weight dependant. Considering the molecular weights of the selected phenolic compounds for this study, it is proposed that phenolic substances with a pKa < 7 and MW > 180 will be adsorbed by the HyXs selected. In addition, the non-ionic-based adsorption of the phenolic compounds did not follow the Langmuir monolayer adsorption model."
"The viability of conjugated polymer thin film electrooptical devices and sensors depends strongly on high quantum efficiency thin films with excellent charge and exciton mobilities.1,2 The brightness of electroluminescent devices depends on the charge transport and emission efficiency, and energy migration to low energy sites can provide the necessary wavelength shifts for lasing.3 A highly sensitive and specific sensory device requires that a recognition event be coupled to an amplification mechanism. We are particularly interested in exploiting the collective transport properties of electrons, electron holes, or excitons traveling along a conjugated polymer backbone to amplify analyte binding events.1 Movement of these excited states strongly depends on the interaction and orientation of an individual polymer relative to its neighbors.4 Interchain distance has strong impact on the performance of electrooptical devices based on conjugated polymers5 and only very recently has a theoretical model describing the interaction between neighboring chains become available.6 Despite the accepted fact that interchain interactions alter photoluminescent properties of conjugated polymers, no reports of a general method for controlling the interchain spacing have appeared. In both small molecules7 and polymers,4d,e close association of π-systems often causes a substantial decrease in the PL quantum yield relative to isolated chromophores. The diminished PL quantum yields make conjugated polymer thin films containing close cofacial π-stacking unattractive for use as transducing elements in chemosensors.8 However, minimizing interpolymer distance is necessary for optimal energy transfer of excitons between polymer chains.4d,e Interrogation of the influence that interchain distance has on thin film photophysics requires precise control over the packing and order of the individual polymer chains with respect to one another.9 By restricting the polymer chains to a 2-dimensional liquid interface, a Langmuir monolayer provides the requisite polymer ordering and dynamics necessary to probe interchain effects. Scheme 1 depicts poly(p-phenylene ethynylenes) (PPEs)10 containing a substitution pattern (regiorandom) where the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups are para to each other producing an “edge-on” organization at the air-water interface.12 Our previous studies indicated that the edge-on orientation forces the phenyl rings (barring any steric repulsion) on the polymer chains to pack in a close cofacial manner causing fluorescence quenching. Despite the low quantum yields, the edge-on polymers are attractive because Langmuir-Blodgett or Langmuir-Schaefer13 films of these polymers provide high surface density and orient polar recognition elements toward the air-film interface. Herein, we report a systematic study of the relationship between cofacial interpolymer distance and solid-state photophysics. We predict that increasing the interpolymer distance will provide improved photophysical properties. To investigate our hypothesis, polymers (1-3) with differing degrees of side chain bulk were synthesized.14 As expected, the side chain bulk influences the packing of the polymers at the air-water interface. Table 1 includes the area per repeating unit for polymers 1-3, derived from extrapolated onset of the pressure-area isotherm. The area per repeating unit increases as the bulk of the side chain increases from dimethyl (1) to diisopentyl (3) and the area per repeat unit suggests that both subunits in each polymer orient edge-on. We calculate interchain distances of 4.0, 4.4, and 4.9 A for polymers 1, 2, and 3 respectively.12 X-ray diffraction data obtained from drop cast films of polymers 1-3 on aluminum corroborate the interchain distance trend observed on the Langmuir trough. From the X-ray data, interchain spacings of 3.6, 3.9, and 4.3 A were observed for polymers 1-3 respectively, providing further indication that increased side chain bulk provides greater polymerpolymer spacing.15"
"We have studied Langmuir monolayers of saturated fatty acid-alcohol mixtures (same chain length) and acid-acid mixtures (different chain length) using isotherms and X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data confirm that the constituents are miscible, and that at zero pressure the mixed acid-alcohol monolayer areas are less than the areas of the pure components. We have determined the phase diagrams of a number of different mixtures. In any given phase, the intermolecular distances measured perpendicular to the molecules are independent of the pressure and of the constituents of the mixture. However, the location of some phase boundaries is a strong function of the composition of the mixture."
"The antiparasitic property of peptides is believed to be associated with their interactions with the protozoan membrane, which calls for research on the identification of membrane sites capable of peptide binding. In this study we investigated the interaction of a lipophilic glutathioine peptide known to be effective against the African Sleeping Sickness (ASS — African Trypanosomiasis) and cell membrane models represented by Langmuir monolayers. It is shown that even small amounts of the peptide affect the monolayers of some phospholipids and other lipids, which points to a significant interaction. The latter did not depend on the electrical charge of the monolayer-forming molecules but the peptide action was particularly distinctive for cholesterol + sphingomyelin monolayers that roughly resemble rafts on a cell membrane. Using in situ polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), we found that the orientation of the peptide is affected by the phospholipids and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB), but not in monolayers comprising cholesterol + sphingomyelin. In this mixed monolayer resembling rafts, the peptide still interacts and has some induced order, probably because the peptide molecules are fitted together into a compact monolayer. Therefore, the lipid composition of the monolayer modulates the interaction with the lipophilic glutathioine peptide, and this may have important implications in understanding how the peptide acts on specific sites of the protozoan membrane."
"The bacterial membrane interaction of the antimicrobial peptide microcin J25 was studied with the probe-free techniques Langmuir monolayers and infrared spectroscopy. Membrane model systems composed by phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylglycerol 7:3, which mimic the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram negative bacteria, were used in both monolayer and bilayer approaches. The peptide reduced the transition surface pressure of the expanded-to-condensed lipid monolayer states, as well as increased the gel-to-liquid crystalline transition temperature in bilayers, indicating a stabilization of membrane ordered state. In addition, a reduction of the surface pressure at which condensed domains appeared was observed upon mixed monolayers compression after microcin J25 adsorption. The results indicate a favorable interaction of microcin J25 with bacterial membrane model systems. Also, the effects on the ordered phases stabilization are discussed in terms of the biological effects observed in membranes of sensitive cells."
"A double-tailed surfactant, for example, dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB), tends to form bilayer fragments rather than vesicles in aqueous solution upon sonication. This Letter reports on the morphological transformations of the membrane fragments leading to multilamellar vesicle formation. The surfactant membranes were swollen with tetra(11-methoxy-11-oxoundecyl)tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (3) (a cyclosiloxane with covalently attached fatty-acid esters) up to 50 mol % based on the surfactant content. That compound was synthesized by hydrosilylation of 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane with four molecules of methyl undec-10-enoate. Using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), it has been shown that densely stacked multilamellar vesicles form spontaneously in the sonicated DODAB dispersion containing 50 mol % of the compound 3 after adjusting pH to the value of 9.5. This occurs as a result of the hydrolysis of ester bonds of the compound 3 inside the membrane with formation of tetra(11-carboxyundecyl)tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (4). The carboxylic groups in compound 4 are ionized under experimental conditions. That results in the appearance of the negative charge at the surface which neutralizes the positively charged molecules of DODAB, thus reducing repulsive interactions between the membrane fragments. Additionally, as was shown using Langmuir monolayer measurements, the presence of compound 4 expands the DODAB film and decreases its bending rigidity. That makes the bending process considerably easier and promotes formation of multilamellar vesicles."
"The diversity of chemical structure of lipids present in the cell membranes, concerning both a hydrophilic (polarity and charge) and hydrophobic (chain length and unsaturation of fatty acids residues) parts, assists in providing suitable physical and chemical properties for the course of multiple reaction within the membrane. This review presents the results of the changes in the lipid composition of native membranes of plant cells under stress conditions and during developmental processes. It also discussed the use of lipids to create model systems which allow for interpretation of specificity of reactions taking place in the membrane fragments. The spontaneous formation by lipids closed spherical structures (bi-layers) in an aqueous medium, and monolayers at the water/air interface creates a convenient model system for the native membranes. The review focuses on the techniques of electrokinetic potential (zeta potential) measurements and Langmuir monolayers’ studies. The first gives the possibility to conclude about the modification of the polar part of the membranes, the second allows to determine their structural properties (fluidity, stiffness). The relatively rapid modification of the lipid composition under stress and during the course of developmental processes to ensure the optimal functions of membranes and organelles includes the changes of hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of lipid, as an important factor influencing the course of multiple reactions in cells. Understanding the physicochemical properties of lipids that accompany these processes may contribute to the correct description of the functionality of the cells under these conditions."
"The surface potential technique is employed to estimate the dissociation constant (K) of a series of aromatic carboxylic acids in the form of Langmuir monolayers. Using electric surface potential (ΔV) measurements of monolayers spread on aqueous subphases, containing different concentrations of Na+, and applying the Gouy–Chapman theory as well as the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, the surface pK for the investigated compounds falls in the range of 4.5–5.6 with the mean value of 5.1. The other method, based on surface potential measurements of monolayers of the parent, unsubstituted compound (5′-phenyl-m-terphenyl-4-carboxylic acid) spread on aqueous solutions with distinct pHs, leads to a pK of ca. 6.5 which corresponds to the bulk conditions. This value is shifted towards neutral pH as compared to the one calculated with the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (5.3), owing to the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen ions caused by partial ionization of carboxylic groups of the monolayer molecules."
"Abstract Photosystem I (PSI), a robust and abundant biomolecule capable of delivering high‐energy photoelectrons, has a great potential for the fabrication of light‐driven semi‐artificial bioelectrodes. Although possibilities have been explored in this regard, the true capabilities of this technology have not been achieved yet, particularly for their use as bioanodes. Here, the use of PSI Langmuir monolayers and their electrical wiring with specifically designed redox polymers is shown, ensuring an efficient mediated electron transfer as the basis for the fabrication of an advanced biophotoanode. The bioelectrode is rationally implemented and optimized for enabling the generation of substantial photocurrents of up to 17.6 µ A cm −2 and is even capable of delivering photocurrents at potentials as low as − 300 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode, surpassing the performance of comparable devices. To highlight the applicability of the developed light‐driven bioanode, a biophotovoltaic cell is assembled in combination with a gas‐breathing biocathode. The assembly operates in a single compartment cell and delivers considerable power outputs at large cell voltages. The implemented biophotoanode constitutes an important step toward the development of advanced biophotovoltaic devices."
"Collagen is a skeleton of native extracellular matrix (ECM) that is known to provide mechanical and structural stability. In an attempt to develop a new connective cellular model with the surrounding ECM without further experimental complications, such as the reconstitution of ECM receptors, we designed the experiments and discovered that the fibrillogenesis of membrane-bound collagen is not spontaneous as it is in the form of free collagen in bulk solution. The confocal microscopic results suggest that cholesterol is a crucial component that facilitates the fibril formation on the membrane surface. In situ X-ray and neutron reflectivity on Langmuir monolayer and solid-supported lipid bilayer models, respectively, reveal two features of cholesterol effects on the collagen fibril formation. Mainly, cholesterol increases the lateral lipid headgroup separation on the membrane surface, which promotes the association degree of collagen monomers. It also enhances the elastic modulus of the membrane to impede membrane filtration by the collagen assemblies."
"We studied the miscibility in binary lipid matrixes made by the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) technique. The components in the lipid matrix were N-(ε-maleimidocaproyl)-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE-EMC; biofunctionalized linker lipid) and a phospholipid. Three different matrix phospholipids were used: 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The phase-transition temperature of the linker lipid as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was 45 °C. The surface potential of the linker lipid, 290 mV at pH 6.8, was clearly smaller than the values observed for pure phospholipids. Clear evidence of the miscibility could not be obtained from the surface pressure−area isotherms. On the contrary, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) enabled a visual investigation of the miscibility and domain morphology. The best miscibility was obtained for DPPC/DPPE-EMC matrixes but only to some extent for DPPE/DPPE-EMC and DMPE/DPPE-EMC matrixes. Atomic force microscopy on solid supported LB films showed domains similar to the BAM images of Langmuir monolayers."
"The lipid bis(guanidinium)-tren-cholesterol (BGTC) is a cationic cholesterol derivative bearing guanidinium polar headgroups used for gene transfection either alone or formulated as liposomes with the zwitterionic lipid 1,2-di-[cis-9-octadecenoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). Previous investigations have shown its ability to strongly interact with DNA and form asymmetric lipid bilayers at the air/water interface when mixed with DOPE. Here, with a view to further investigate its physicochemical behavior, we studied the interactions of mixtures of BGTC with another zwitterionic lipid, 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine, (DMPC), with DNA at the air/water interface by using the Langmuir monolayer technique coupled with Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) and Polarization Modulation Infra Red Reflexion Absorption (PMIRRAS) spectroscopy and we investigate DNA-BGTC/ DMPC interactions. We demonstrate that when DNA is injected into the subphase in excess compared to the positive charges of BGTC, it adsorbs to BGTC/DMPC monolayers at 20 mN/m whatever the lipid monolayer composition (1/5, 2/3 or 3/2 BGTC/DMPC molar ratio) and forms an incomplete monolayer of either isotropic or anisotropic double strands depending on the BGTC content in the monolayer. Compression beyond the collapse of some mixed DNA-BGTC/DMPC (2/3 and 3/2 molar ratio) systems leads to the formation of DNA monolayers underneath asymmetric lipid bilayers characterized by a bottom layer of BGTC in contact with DNA and a top layer mainly constituted of DMPC."
"Retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11) has been postulated to be anchored to membranes by means of its N-terminal segment in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells where it participates to the visual cycle. The analysis of the primary sequence of RDH11 revealed that its N-terminal hydrophobic segment could be involved in the anchoring of this enzyme to membranes. However, no information is yet available on the properties of this N-terminal segment to support this role. The secondary structure and membrane binding of two N-terminal peptides of RDH11 with different lengths have thus been investigated to provide this information. Online tools allowed predicting an α-helical secondary structure for both peptides. Infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism have shown that the α-helix of the Long-peptide (35 amino acids) is longer and more rigid than that of the Short-peptide (25 amino acids) regardless of the type of solvent. Langmuir monolayers have been used as a model membrane to study lipid-peptide interactions. Values of maximum insertion pressure and synergy suggested a preferential binding of the Long-peptide to lipids with a phosphoethanolamine polar head group, which are abundant in the RPE. Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy in monolayers has shown that the α-helical structure of the Long-peptide is more stable in the presence of saturated phospholipids whereas the structure of the Short-peptide is mainly disordered. Altogether, the present data demonstrate that the α-helical hydrophobic core of the N-terminal segment of RDH11 displays properties typical of transmembrane domains, in agreement with its postulated role in the membrane anchoring of this protein."
"Chiral discrimination in Langmuir monolayers of amphiphilic 1-stearylamine-glycerol is studied using the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical method. Using the experimental information about the lattice structure [D. Vollhardt, U. Gehlert, J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002, 106, 4419], the intermolecular interaction profiles for enantiomeric and racemic pair are studied as a function of mutual tilt and azimuth for different values of intermolecular separation. The present study reveals that, at shorter separation, the interaction profile of the racemic pair has deeper minima than the enantiomeric pair, whereas at larger separation the minimum of the enantiomeric pair is deeper. Thus, the theoretical studies reveal an interesting crossover from heterochiral preference to homochiral preference in 1-stearylamine-glycerol monolayers, with the increase in the intermolecular separation corresponding to a larger area per molecule in the monolayer. This predicts that, with gradual compression, the interactions between racemic pair dominate the experimental features, whereas, under nonequilibrium conditions at the beginning of the formation of the condensed phase, the experimental characteristics of homochirality are observable. The study conclusively shows that the chiral structure of the molecule and the lattice packing drive the chiral preference at the mesoscopic level."
"The authors new derivatives of the parent macrocyclic ligand dibenzo-(b,i)(1,4,8,11)tetra-aza-(4,11)dihydro-(14)-annulene (TTA) can be divided into two classes on the basis of their behaviour concerning the formation of (floating) Langmuir monolayers and solid-supported Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) monolayers and multilayers. Class I consists of molecules that are highly hydrophobic but do not contain a formal hydrophilic centre whereas the class II molecules are truly amphiphilic. The class I compounds all formed stable Langmuir monolayers at surface pressures of 10-15 mN m-1 for prolonged periods and, for the C(6) and C(14) compounds, similar stability was also observed at up to 40 mN m-1. Although the C(14) material failed to deposit as an LB film, limited multilayer deposition (X or Z-type) was displayed by the other members in class I. In class II, only the di-cumylphenoxy-derivative of the cobalt(II) complex of TAA (CPTAACo, TAA as defined previously) was found to form satisfactory LB multilayers for which a surface pressure in the range 16-20 mNm-1 was employed. The Langmuir monolayers of the other members of this class were too rigid for LB deposition. Some observations concerning the effect of NOX upon an LB film of CPTAACo are described."
"Abstract 1,2-Bis(dihydrophytyl)glycero-3-phosphate (DPhyPA) was synthesized as an analog of archaebacterial lipids. Upon sonicating in amine-containing buffers like 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), the lipid gave rise to the stable liposomal assemblies, which could store 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein at high temperature as high as 70 °C in the interior. The assembly also had a large negative zeta-potential and showed an absence of gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition from −20 to 80 °C. A Langmuir monolayer at an air/water interface suggested that the maximum molecular area of the lipid was 0.9—1.0 nm2. These properties were compared with the assemblies prepared from conventional 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine."
"A twin-tailed, twin-chiral fatty acid, (2R,3R)-(+)-bis(decyloxy)succinic acid was synthesized and its two dimensional behavior at the air−water interface was examined. The pH of the subphase had a profound effect on the monolayer formation. On acidic subphase, stable monolayers with increased area per molecule due to hydrogen bonding and bilayers at collapse pressures were observed. Highly compressible films were formed at 40 °C, while stable monolayers with increased area were observed at sub-room temperatures. Langmuir monolayers formed on subphases containing 1 mM ZnCl2 and CaCl2 revealed two dimensional metal complex formation with Zn2+ forming a chelate-type complex, while Ca2+ formed an ionic-type complex. Monolayers transferred from the condensed phase onto hydrophilic Si(100) and quartz substrates revealed the formation of bilayers through transfer-induced monolayer buckling. Compression induced crystallites in 2D from monolayers and vesicle-like supramolecular structures from multilayers were the noted LB film characteristics, adopting optical imaging and electron microscopy. The interfacial monolayer structure studied through molecular dynamics simulation revealed the order and packing at a molecular level; monolayers adsorbed at various simulated specific areas of the molecule corroborated the (π−A) isotherm and the formation of a hexagonal lattice at the air−water interface."
"At the heart of understanding cellular processes lies our ability to explore the specific nature of communication between sequential information carrying biopolymers. However, the data extracted from conventional solution phase studies may not reflect the dynamics of communication between recognized partners as they occur in the crowded cellular milieu. We use the principle of immobilization of histidine-tagged biopolymers at a Ni(II)-encoded Langmuir monolayer to study sequence-specific protein-protein interactions in an artificially crowded environment. The advantage of this technique lies in increasing the surface density of one of the interacting partners that allows us to study macromolecular interactions in a controlled crowded environment, but without compromising the speed of the reactions. We have taken advantage of this technique to follow the sequential assembly process of the multiprotein complex Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the interface and also deciphered the role of one of the proteins, omega (ω), in the assembly pathway. Our reconstitution studies indicate that in the absence of molecular chaperones or other cofactors, omega (ω) plays a decisive role in refolding the largest protein beta prime (β') and its recruitment into the multimeric assembly to reconstitute an active RNA polymerase. It was also observed that the monolayer had the ability to distinguish between sequence-specific and -nonspecific interactions despite the immobilization of one of the biomacromolecules. The technique provides a universal two-dimensional template for studying protein-ligand interactions while mimicking molecular crowding."
"We report the observation of an unusual stripe-droplet transition in precompressed Langmuir monolayers consisting of mixtures of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) amphiphiles and phospholipids. This highly reproducible and fully reversible transition occurs at approximately zero surface pressure during expansion (or compression) of the monolayer following initial compression into a two-dimensional solid phase. It is characterized by spontaneous emergence of an extended, disordered stripe-like morphology from an optically homogeneous phase during gradual expansion. These stripe patterns appear as a transient feature and continuously progress, involving gradual coarsening and ultimate transformation into a droplet morphology upon further expansion. Furthermore, varying relative concentrations of the two amphiphiles and utilizing amphiphiles with considerably longer ethylene glycol headgroups reveal that this pattern evolution occurs in narrow concentration regimes, values of which depend on ethylene oxide headgroup size. These morphological transitions are reminiscent of those seen during a passage through a critical point by variations in thermodynamic parameters (e.g., temperature or pressure) as well as those involving spinodal decomposition. While the precise mechanism cannot be ascertained using present experiments alone, our observations can be reconciled in terms of modulations in competing interactions prompted by the pancake-mushroom-brush conformational transitions of the ethylene glycol headgroup. This in turn suggests that the conformational degree of freedom represents an independent order parameter, or a switch, which can induce large-scale structural reorganization in amphiphilic monolayers. Because molecular conformational changes are pervasive in biological membranes, we speculate that such conformational transition-induced pattern evolution might provide a physical mechanism by which membrane processes are amplified."
"Alamethicin (ALM), a 20-amino acid antibiotic peptide (peptaibol) from fungal sources, was mixed in Langmuir monolayers with six different surfactants: semifluorinated (F6H18, F10H19, F8H10OH, F6H10SH) and hydrogenated (C18SH and DODAC), aimed at finding appropriate molecules for ALM incorporation for nanodevice construction. Alamethicin-containing mixed monolayers were investigated by means of surface manometry (π-A isotherms) and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). Our results show that only semifluorinated alkanes can serve as an appropriate material since they form miscible and homogeneous monolayers with ALM within the whole concentration range. All the remaining surfactants, possessing polar groups, were found to demix with ALM. This effect was explained as being due to the existence of strong polar interactions between vertically oriented surfactant molecules, which tend to separate from horizontally oriented α-helices of the peptide. On the contrary, semifluorinated alkanes, lacking any polar group in their structure and bearing a large dipole moment, interact with ALM, also possessing a huge cumulative dipole moment. These dipole−dipole interactions between ALM and SFAs are more attractive than those between SFA molecules in their pure monolayers, causing the large ALM molecule, situated parallel to the interface, to be surrounded by SFA molecules in perpendicular orientation, leading to the formation of a highly organized binary mixed monolayer. BAM images of the ALM monolayer indicate that this peptide collapses with the nucleation and growth mechanism, like the majority of surfactants, which contradicts the model of ALM collapse by desorption, previously published in the literature."
"Adsorption behaviour of PEI on silicon carbide powder was measured by using UV spectrum. The surface charge of SiC powder was changed greatly after the addition of PEI, its IEP changed from pH=2.0 to pH=10.5. Adsorption isotherms of dispersant on the silicon carbide surface were investigated. Their adsorption behaviour belongs to Langmuir monolayer adsorption type. The maximum amount of PEI--H+(pH=3.57) adsorbed on the SiC surface is 0.0172mg/mL and that of PEI--H+(pH=6.61) is 0.0208mg/mL. IR spectra were obtained to verify this adsorption effect."
"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is frequently used in lipid experiments to remove redundant ions, such as Ca2+, from the sample solution. In this work, combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Langmuir monolayer experiments, we show that on top of the expected Ca2+ depletion, EDTA anions themselves bind to phosphatidylcholine (PC) monolayers. This binding, originating from EDTA interaction with choline groups of PC lipids, leads to the adsorption of EDTA anions at the monolayer surface and concentration-dependent changes in surface pressure as measured by monolayer experiments and explained by MD simulations. This surprising observation emphasizes that lipid experiments carried out using EDTA-containing solutions, especially of high concentrations, must be interpreted very carefully due to potential interfering interactions of EDTA with lipids and other biomolecules involved in the experiment, e.g., cationic peptides, that may alter membrane-binding affinities of studied compounds."

Supported bioactive bilayer membranes were created by Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) deposition of either a pure poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipid, having PEG head groups of various lengths, or 50 mol % binary mixtures of a PEG lipid and a novel collagen-like peptide amphiphile on a hydrophobic surface. The peptide amphiphile contains a peptide synthetically lipidated by covalent linkage to hydrophobic dialkyl tails. The amphiphile head group lengths were determined using neutron reflectivity. Cell adhesion and spreading assays showed that the cell response to the membranes depends on the length difference between head groups of the membrane components. Cells adhere and spread on mixtures of the peptide amphiphile with the PEG lipids having PEG chains of 120 and 750 molecular weight (MW). In contrast, cells adhered but did not spread on the mixture containing the 2000 MW PEG. Cells did not adhere to any of the pure PEG lipid membranes or to the mixture containing the 5000 MW PEG. Selective masking of a ligand on a surface is one method of controlling the surface bioactivity. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res, 50, 75–81, 2000.

"A potential biochar from pepper stems (PS-biochar) was developed via a one-stage pyrolysis process of precursor at 700 °C and employed to adsorb ibuprofen (IBP) in water media. Results showed that PS-biochar was a carbonaceous mesoporous adsorbent with well-developed porosity (SBET= 727.5 m2/g and VTotal= 0.36 cm3/g) and rich surface functional groups. Mechanism of IBP adsorption consisted mainly of π- π interaction, pore filling, and H-bonding. The Langmuir monolayer capacity (569.6 mg/g) was very high compared to values reported in similar studies. The negative signal of thermodynamic parameters (∆G°, ∆H°, and ∆S°) suggests the spontaneous, exothermic, and physical nature of interactions. The successful PS-biochar regeneration after four cycles in the batch system confirmed the high performance of the NaOH (0.1 M) as a desorbing agent. Therefore, the prepared biochar can be considered as a cost-effective and high-performance material for water decontamination."
"Langmuir monolayers of pentadecanoic acid (C15) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) are investigated in liquid expanded–liquid condensed (LE–LC) phase co-existence region in order to study evolution of circular and undulating LC domains. The Brewster angle microscopy is analyzed to evaluate LC domain size and shape for various average molecular areas. For C15 monolayer circular domain shape and continuous increase of domain size are observed. In contrast, for DPPC monolayer undulating domain shapes are observed, where the mode of oscillations m is quantized depending on the average molecular area. Surprisingly, also the average domain size is quantized and depends on m . These observations are discussed in accordance with the phase rule modified for the monolayer phase co-existence region and observed levels of domain sizes are compared with theories of m -fold distortion."
"Anti-malarial methylene blue (MB) doped in arachidic acid (AA) have been incorporated in the Langmuir monolayer at the air–water interface and also in the Langmuir–Blodgett films deposited on quartz substrate. The pressure–area (π–A) isotherm studies at different concentrations of MB pointed out that pure MB could not form stable monolayer at the air–water interface and collapse readily at very low surface pressures. However, mixture of MB with AA formed stable monolayers and they could be transferred into solid quartz substrate to form mono/multi layered films of MB. The area per molecule of floating mixed monolayers was systematically decreased with the increasing concentrations of MB in the mixture. The pressure–time (π - t) isotherm study indicated the interaction kinetics between MB and AA. Higher the concentration of MB, higher is the increase in pressure. The spectroscopic characteristics of the mixed LB films have been compared with that of pure MB solution, microcrystal and layer-by-layer self assembled film with UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Surface morphology of the mixed LB and LbL film of MB was measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM)."
"The technique of fluorescence microscopy, a long-standing, powerful, and still evolving research tool in molecular biology, has recently found application to the study of Langmuir monolayers and to multilayers and vesicles. In this review, the basic instrumentation of fluorescence microscopy will be reviewed and a number of powerful modifications of the technique will be surveyed. Resolution limits of the techniques will be discussed. The technique of fluorescence photobleaching recovery is used to study diffusion rates. Fluorescence polarization microscopy measures orientational distributions and the rotational diffusion of molecules. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy can be used to selectively excite fluorophores near an aqueous-glass interface. Spectral resolution is employed in the techniques of fluorescence ratio imaging and multiparameter studies using more than one kind of probe molecule. Improved two-dimensional sectioning is achieved by confocal techniques using laser scanning leading to the realization of three-dimensional fluorescence imaging. After a concise survey of the most prominent biophysical applications, recent work on Langmuir monolayers will be described."
"Adsorption of gold, and palladium species containing chlorine ions species onto commercial N-{2-[Bis(2-aminoethyl)amino]ethyl}aminomethyl–polystyrene polymer beads (TRIS) were investigated. The influence of the pH, initial metal ion concentration, and contact time on the adsorption performance was examined in a batch adsorption experiment. Langmuir, Modified Langmuir, Freundlich and Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm model variables are calculated. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities of the Pd (II), and Au (III) chlorine ions species were found to be 204.5, and 168.5 mg/g, respectively. The two metal adsorption kinetics fit the pseudo-second order kinetic models. In thermodynamic calculations, the choice of different equilibrium constant and withal using dimension containing constant usage are an important problem in the field. To overcome these problems, the Modified Langmuir isotherm equilibrium constant is used at determination of thermodynamic parameters. Adsorption mechanism steps were characterized by using FT-IR, SEM, and EDS. The adsorbent is interacted with each metal ions in HCl solution electrostatic interaction and surface complex formation between the amine groups. The calculation of the thermodynamic parameters using the dimensionless modified Langmuir equilibrium constant calculated more satisfying and more reliable way. All thermodynamic parameters suggested that Pd (II) and Au (III) adsorptions onto TRIS beads was a spontaneous, physisorption."
"Over the last years, algal blooms occurrences have increased on the Romanian Black Sea coast. In this study, Ulva rigida and Cladophora sericea green algae were used to investigate the removal of As(III), As(V), Sb(III), Se(IV) and Se(VI) in aqueous solution. In virgin forms, both macroalgae showed good perspectives for application on antimony and selenium uptake from water, although no significant efficiency towards arsenic was observed. Several treatments were applied to the algae to eventually enhance their adsorption capacity. Potentiometric titrations and infrared spectroscopy confirmed favorable chemical modifications in algae surface due to HDTMA and ammonium treatments, although no considerable increase in the biosorption ability was found. C. sericea, in virgin form, was selected for further studies on the uptake of Se(IV) and Se(VI). The best results for Se(IV) removal (0.5 mg/g) were found at pH 2–4 and for Se(VI) (0.2 mg/g) at pH 2–3. The equilibrium isotherm for the adsorption of Se(IV), at pH 2 and 20 °C, reported a maximum experimental adsorbed amount of 0.74 mg/g and a Langmuir monolayer capacity of 4 mg/g, which are substantial values considering that the biosorbent (dead marine seaweeds) is a residue and requires no significant processing before use."
