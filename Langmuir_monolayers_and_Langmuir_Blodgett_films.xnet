"Langmuir monolayers of polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymers (with the same PS block length and different P2VP block lengths) formed at the air/water interface were characterized with the Langmuir film balance technique. Nonselective and selective solvents were used to spread the samples on the water surface and the spreading solvents showed large effect on the surface pressure–molecular area isotherms. The corresponding Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the samples were characterized with atomic force microscopy. The LB films transferred from the Langmuir monolayers spread with a nonselective solvent only exhibited isolated circular micelles, while those with a selective solvent exhibited quite different morphologies including planar structure, rodlike structure, circular micelles, and labyrinth pattern. As far as we know, the labyrinth pattern appears in the LB films for the first time."
"Stable, insoluble Langmuir monolayer films composed of Staphylococcus aureus-specific lytic bacteriophage were formed at an air-water interface and characterized. The phage monolayer was very strong, withstanding a surface pressure of ∼40 mN/m at 20 °C. The surface pressure-area (Π-A) isotherm possessed a shoulder at ∼7 × 10(4)nm(2)/phage particle, attributed to a change in phage orientation at the air-water interface from horizontal to vertical capsid-down/tail-up orientation as surface pressure was increased. The Π-A-dependence was accurately described using the Volmer equation of state, assuming horizontal orientation to an air-water interface at low surface pressures with an excluded area per phage particle of 4.6 × 10(4)nm(2). At high pressures phage particles followed the space-filling densely packed disks model with a specific area of 8.5 × 10(3)nm(2)/phage particle. Lytic phage monolayers were transferred onto gold-coated silica substrates from the air-water interface at a constant surface pressure of 18 mN/m by Langmuir-Blodgett method, then dried and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ellipsometry. Phage specific adsorption (Γ) in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films measured by SEM was consistent with that calculated independently from Π-A isotherms at the transfer surface pressure of 18 mN/m (Γ=23 phage particles/μm(2)). The 50 nm-thickness of phage monolayer measured by ellipsometer agreed well with the horizontal phage average size estimated by SEM. Surface properties of phage Langmuir monolayer compare well with other monolayers formed from nano- and micro-particles at the air-water interface and similar to that of classic amphiphiles 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (phospholipid) and stearic acid."
"The formation of Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir−Blodgett films is reported for the first time for a polyaniline oligomer, 16-mer, that was mixed with cadmium stearate. The processibility of this oligomeric material was greatly improved as compared to the parent polyaniline, which allowed one to use common solvents like chloroform as the spreading solvent. Analogously to composite polyaniline monolayers, the stability and the transferability are found to depend on the 16-mer content in the composite film, with poor stability and low transfer ratios above 60% of 16-mer. Deposited Langmuir−Blodgett films were found to be undoped (or only weakly doped) since they were obtained from monolayers spread onto aqueous subphases (pH = 6.0). Uniform Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) deposition was confirmed by optical microscopy and UV−vis spectra whose intensity increased linearly with the number of layers deposited and also with the 16-mer content. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results revealed that cadmium stearate was transferred together with the 16-mer. Upon doping in HCl vapor, the electrical conductivity of the deposited LB films was seen to increase by 1 order of magnitude."
"Langmuir monolayers (LM) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of pure lipophilic meso-tetra(4-dodecylaminosulfophenyl)porphyrin (PC12) and mixed with the anionic surfactant sodium hexadecylsulfate (SHS) were studied. The molecular packing and structure of PC12 and PC12-4SHS with variable surface pressure were investigated by surface pressure-area measurements, steady-state absorption, fluorescence emission and anisotropy, as well as by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). At low surface pressure, the porphyrin molecules are organized with the rings tilted on the water surface whereas at high surface pressure the porphyrin rings achieve a more perpendicular arrangement. Using the FLIM images a gradual change of aggregates into large "islands" is observed. Different patterns are observed in the pure PC12 multilayer films (n = 3 and 5) with ordered patches superimposed which are not observed in the PC12-4SHS multilayer LB films."
"The interaction of chitosan with bio-membranes, which plays important role in deciding its use in biological applications, is realized by investigating the interaction of chitosan with stearic acid (fatty acid) in Langmuir monolayers (at air–water interface) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films (after transferring it onto solid substrate). It is found from the pressure-area isotherms that the chitosan insertion causes an expansion of chitosan-fatty acid hybrid monolayers, which reduces the elasticity and make the film heterogeneous. It is likely that at low surface pressure chitosan is situated at the interface, interacting with stearic acid molecules via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions whereas at high pressure chitosan mainly located at subsurface beneath stearic acid molecules. In the latter case the interaction is predominantly electrostatic yielding very small contribution to the surface pressure. The reduction of temperature of the subphase water allows more number of chitosan molecules to reach surface to increase the pressure/interaction. On the other hand, although pure chitosan is found difficult to relocate on the substrate from air-water interface due to its hydrophilic-like nature, it alongside stearic acid (amphiphilic molecules) can be transferred onto substrate using LB technique as evident from infrared spectra. Their out-of-plane and in-plane structures, as extracted from two complementary surface sensitive techniques- X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy, are found strongly dependent on the chitosan mole fraction and the deposition pressure. These analysis of the film-structure will essentially allow one to model the system better and provide better insight into the interaction."

"Langmuir monolayers of an amphiphilic spiropyran, 1′,3′-dihydro-3′,3′-dimethyl-6-nitro-1′-octadecyl-8-docosanoyloxymethylspiro[1-benzopyran-2,2′-indole] (SP1822) on pure water at 30 °C was investigated by measurements of surface pressure–area (π–A) isotherms and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). The π–A isotherm shows a phase transition at 7.5 mN m−1. The BAM image reveals drastic morphological changes accompanying the phase transition. Many circular domains appear on uniform monolayers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of as-deposited Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films suggest that the circular domains consist of bilayers. In addition, monolayers are transformed into bilayers during deposition, which result in the formation of further larger circular domains. Furthermore, the relationship between photochemical property and morphology in the SP1822 LB films was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy and AFM. We have demonstrated that whether J-aggregates are formed upon irradiation with UV light at room temperature is strongly dependent on the morphology of the SP1822 LB films before irradiation."
"The film-forming behavior of nanosized metallic clusters composed of 55 gold atoms, isolated from each other by a thin organic ligand shell with a total size of 2.1 nm in diameter, was investigated by pressure-area isotherms, constant pressure relaxation and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) at the air–water interface. The monolayer was transferred onto various substrates by using the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on the LB films reveals a partially close packing of the clusters."
"As a potential compound for use in optical fiber fluorescence sensor for rapid detection of saxitoxin, 4-(monoaza-18-crown-6-methyl)-7-octadecanoylaminocoumarin (ODAC) was synthesized and the interfacial and spectroscopic properties of its Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films were studied. The surface pressure− and surface potential−area isotherms were obtained on a pure water subphase. In situ fluorescence of the ODAC monolayer at the air−water interface showed a fluorescence band centered around 425 nm (λex = 332 nm) decreasing in intensity with increasing surface pressure. This observation is due to the self-quenching of the ODAC molecules as the surface concentration per unit area increases and aggregates are formed. To reduce the aggregation phenomenon, mixed monolayers of ODAC with C18GlyGlyAlaGlyNH2 peptidolipid (PL) (PL:ODAC, 20:1 and 100:1) were used to dilute the fluorophore molecules at the air−water interface and diminish the self-quenching. LB films of pure ODAC and PL:ODAC mixed monolayers (100:1) were prepared and tested on saxitoxin dissolved in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Each LB film showed fluorescence increase in the presence of saxitoxin."
"New 1-acyl-1,2,4-triazoles (ATs) with different n-alkyl chain lengths from C2 to C18 were synthesized. ATs with long n-alkyl chains (C12 and larger) are non-charged amphiphilic molecules with a polar triazole head group. The Langmuir isotherms of ATs at the air-water interface with 12 (DoT-C12), 14 (MyT-C14), 16 (PaT-C16) and 18 (StT-C18) carbon atoms in their n-alkyl chains were studied using surface pressure-mean molecular area (pi-mmA) measurements. Characteristic for the Langmuir isotherms of PaT-C16 and StT-C-18 was the first sharp increase of the surface pressure at a mmA value of approximately 20A(2) marking a transition of the ATs from the gaseous state with n-alkyl chains already oriented perpendicular to the water surface to a condensed state. The collapse of the monolayers occurred between 20 and 36mNm(-1) with a typical 'spike' in the isotherms of MyT-C14, PaT-C16 and StT-C18 which can be assigned to the buckling and subsequent folding of the monolayer. After the collapse point a pseudo-plateau region of slightly increasing surface pressure appeared for all ATs from C12 to C18 indicating a trilayer formation by the roll-over mechanism for MyT-C14, PaT-C16 and StT-C18. Upon further compression the final collapse occurred at pi values between 59 and 67mNm(-1). From reversibility studies it was found that the Langmuir isotherms of the ATs were irreversible. The morphology of Langmuir-Blodgett films of ATs transferred onto silicon wafers was studied by atomic force microscopy."
"Colloidal membranous vesicles based on the functionalized liposomes are promising for development of novel efficient systems of controlled and stimuli-triggered drug delivery. In particular, the specific metabolism of cancer cells results in significant acidification in tumors, and thus the corresponding pH value changes can be used as a stimulus for drug release specifically in the tumor areas. pH-sensitive liposomes can be formed via incorporation of special pH-sensitive amphiphilic compounds into the liposomal membrane. Molecules of such compounds undergo a conformational transition caused by certain changes in the pH value of aqueous environment and resulting in corresponding membrane perturbations with rapid leakage of drug content from those liposomes into the areas with corresponding acidity. In the present work the pH-induced changes of Langmuir monolayer compression isotherm and of the structure of corresponding Langmuir-Blodgett films of pH-sensitive synthetic lipid trans-4,5,didodecyloxycarbonyl-trans-2-morpholinocyclohexanol have been observed and studied. The substantial expansion of Langmuir monolayer of that lipid caused by change of the aqueous subphase pH value from 7 to 5 was observed. Corresponding monolayer Langmuir-Blodgett films were deposited on mica substrate surface and studied using AFM technique. The substantial differences in the structure of Langmuir-Blodgett films deposited at pH values 7 and 5 were found. The observed effects directly demonstrate the pH-induced structural transformations in organized condensed planar molecular systems formed by pH-sensitive lipid molecules which underlie the pH-sensitivity of corresponding liposomal bilayer membranes containing such lipids."
"In this work, we studied the interaction of two oxidized lipids, PoxnoPC and PazePC, with POPC phospholipid. Mean molecular areas obtained from (π-A) isotherms of mixed PoxnoPC-POPC and PazePC-POPC monolayers revealed different behaviors of these two oxidized lipids: the presence of PoxnoPC in the monolayers induces their expansion, mean molecular areas being higher than those expected in the case of ideal mixtures. PazePC-POPC behave on the whole ideally. This difference can be explained by a different conformation of oxidized lipids. Moreover the carboxylic function of PazePC is protonated under our experimental conditions, as shown by (π-A) isotherms of PazePC at different pH values. Both oxidized lipids induce also an increase of the monolayer elasticity, PoxnoPC being slightly more efficient than PazePC. These monolayers were transferred from the air-water interface onto mica supports for a study by AFM. AFM images are on the whole homogenous, suggesting the presence of only one lipid phase in both cases. However, in the case of PazePC-POPC monolayers, AFM images show also the presence of areas thicker of 7nm to 10nm than the surrounding lipid phase, probably due to the local formation of multilayer systems induced by compression."
"Fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (F-POSS) due to their nanoscale hybrid structure coupled with hydrophobic substituted chains have drawn significant attention as highly hydrophobic and oleophobic materials. That is why the surface properties of such compounds at the molecular level should be analyzed in details. Therefore we studied four different fluorinated closed cage polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) using Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) techniques. The monolayer behavior was investigated by measurements of the surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherm and morphology of the films was visualized using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). The rheological behavior was investigated using interfacial shear rheometer (ISR). The unusual properties of these silsesquioxanes result from their unsymmetrical structure. The hydrophobic character of their fluorinated substituents, combined with the hydrophilicity of the trimethoxysilane moieties lead to specific monolayer properties. The compounds were found to form stable monolayers at the air/water (A/W) interface however the surface activity of POSS derivatives decreases with increasing content of fluorinated moieties in the POSS structure. The monolayers of the studied POSS compounds were also successfully transferred onto the solid substrates as Y-type Langmuir-Blodgett films. The wettability and the structure of the LB film were investigated by measuring the static water contact angle on the glass surface. The presence of fluorinated moieties in the structure of POSS molecules governs the enhanced hydrophobic properties of solid substrate modified by the LB film."

"Properties of the monolayer of octadecyl amine (ODA) molecules on aqueous solution of bromocresol purple (Bcp) dye have been studied over a wide range of pH by measuring the surface pressure-area isotherms. A strong interaction of ODA molecule was observed with the dye molecule in the pH range of 4–9. Under the present study, the dye molecules were adsorbed on the ODA monolayer at the water surface and subsequently a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film of ODA–dye complex was transferred from the air–water interface onto a solid substrate. Alternatively, dye molecules were incorporated into LB film by immersing the predeposited LB film of pure ODA into the dye solution, i.e. by adsorption of dye molecule at the solid–liquid interface. The adsorption behavior of ODA–Bcp dye complexes obtained through these two different routes was characterised with the help of UV–Visible spectroscopy. The nature of the ODA–dye complex deposited from air–water interface using the LB technique was found to be quite different from that of the complex formed by the adsorption of the dye into the pure ODA LB film. The adsorption spectra of the ODA–dye complex obtained from the air–water interface did not change with pH, while those of the ODA–dye complex formed from the solid–liquid interface showed pH dependence."
"Abstract This paper reports the incorporation of an inhibitor of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), viz. Chicago Sky Blue (CSB) dye within an insoluble cationic octadecylamine (ODA) Langmuir monolayer. A surface pressure-area isotherm study confirmed the strong interaction between long chain amine and CSB dye. At higher surface pressure, CSB molecules tend to squeeze out from the octadecylamine monolayer. SEM study confirms this observation. Adsorption kinetics shows that the amount of dye adsorbed depends on the concentration of the dye present in the subphase. It was observed that the absorption process mainly occurred due to the electrostatic interaction between the cationic amino group of long chain amine and the sulphonate group of CSB dye. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic study indicates the formation of aggregates of CSB dye in the mixed (ODA-CSB) LB films.

"A novel azobenzene-derived amphiphile with a melamine head, 2Azo-2C12H2-melamine, has been synthesized. pi-A isotherm measurements displayed that this amphiphile is able to form a stable Langmuir monolayer on both pure water and barbituric acid (BA)- or thymine (T)-containing subphases. The collapse surface pressure and limiting molecular area of its Langmuir monolayer on pure water are 40 mN/m and 0.56 nm2, respectively. However, when barbituric acid or thymine was introduced into the subphase, the corresponding pi-A isotherms of the monolayers exhibited a lower collapse surface pressure (22 mN/m for BA, 21 mN/m for T) and smaller limiting molecular area (0.54 nm2 for BA and 0.52 nm2 for T). UV-vis and FT-IR studies of the LB films formed by 2Azo-2C12H25-melamine have also been carried out. The results indicated that the LB films of 2Azo-2C12H25-melamine deposited from pure water undergo distinct collapse of the H-aggregate upon UV irradiation, while the LB films deposited from a BA- or T-containing subphase retain the H-aggregate. The host-guest-interaction-induced blockage of azobenzene photoisomerization should be responsible for the stabilized H-aggregate. A 1:1 host/guest binding mode to form a linear supramolecular polymeric chain has been proposed in the Langmuir monolayers formed on a BA- or T-containing subphase. The current results suggest that the host-guest interaction should be an effective means to manipulate the interfacial assembly of azobenzene-derived amphiphiles."
"Differrent adsorption behaviors and the orientation of pyranine molecules were investigated for the cationic Langmuir monolayers by using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), two-dimensional (2D) phase behavior with elasticitic property of the monolayers and in situ visible spectroscopy. The structural change in the cationic Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films before and after adsorbing pyranine molecules was found by using small angle and in-plane XRD. The excited-state proton-transfer (ESPT) between octadecylamine (ODA) and pyranine adsorbed in the films was investigated using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy together with consideration of the film structures."

"The synthesis of a new amphiphilic blend of aniline, between a 16-mer oligoaniline and o-pentadecylaniline (oPA), in molecular films is reported and its morphology and UV/Vis absorption properties are characterized. The blend forms stable Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface and successful deposition into Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films was achieved by vertical dipping. By preparing Langmuir monolayers on acidic subphases containing peroxodisulfate, it was straightforward to polymerize the oligomer-monomer mixture. Deposited LB samples exhibited molecularly smooth surfaces, as determined by scanning force microscopy (SFM). The electrooptical properties of mono- and multilayers of 16-mer aniline/oPA mixtures and the polymerized blend were analyzed by UV/Vis spectroscopy."
"This paper reports the monolayer characteristics of cationic octadecylamine (ODA) on both distilled water and aqueous Erythrosine B (EB) dye solution at the air-water interface. From the pressure-area isotherms at various pHs, EB anions in the subphase were found to interact with the insoluble monolayer of cationic octadecylamine (ODA). Adsorption kinetics shows that the amount of dye adsorbed depends on the concentration of the dye present in the subphase. It was observed that the adsorption process mainly occurred due to the electrostatic interaction between the cationic amino group of long chain amine and the anionic part of EB. The spectroscopic characteristics of the mixed LB films, solution, have been compared using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic data. These studies indicate the formation of aggregates in the thin films. Scanning electron microscopic study certainly confirms the presence of aggregates of EB dye in the (ODA-EB) mixed LB films."
"In this paper, we studied the surface properties of recombinant aequorin at the air−water interface. Using the Langmuir monolayer technique, the surface properties of aequorin were studied, including the surface pressure and surface potential−area isotherms, compression−decompression cycles, and stability on Trizma Base (Tris/HCl) buffer at pH 7.6. The results showed that aequorin formed a stable Langmuir monolayer and the surface pressure−area isotherms were dependent on both pH and ionic strength. At a pH higher or lower than 7.6, the limiting molecular area decreased. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of aequorin in aqueous solutions explained this result: when the pH was higher than 7.6, the α-helix conformation changed to unordered structures, whereas at a pH lower than 7.6, the α-helix conformation changed to β-sheet. The addition of calcium chloride to the Tris/HCl buffer subphase (pH 7.6) caused an increase of the limiting molecular area of the aequorin Langmuir monolayer. The fluorescence spectra of a Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) film of aequorin in the presence of calcium chloride indicated that the aequorin transformed to the apoaequorin."
"The structures of mixed Langmuir (floating) monolayers and Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of a phenanthroline-porphyrin with cadmium arachidate (PhenPor + CdAr) have been investigated by synchrotron X-ray grazing incidence diffraction (GIXD) and specular X-ray reflectivity (SXR). GIXD measurements of the floating monolayers showed only one peak, arising from the CdAr domains in the films, at a scattering angle of 21.5°. This is consistent with a hexagonal structure (a = 4.77 Å). The correlation length in these domains is 250 Å. GIXD measurements of the LB films, however, show two sets of diffraction features: one arises from CdAr domains with a rectangular in-plane structure (a = 7.44 Å and b = 4.90 Å) and a correlation length of 85 Å; the other is from porphyrin domains with an oblique in-plane structure (ap = 15.2 Å, bp = 8.86 Å, and γp = 80°) and a correlation length of 105 Å. These dimensions are consistent with the surface pressure−area isotherm measurements and indicate that the two components are immiscible. The thickness of the bilayer is 57 Å, and there is no correlation between the bilayers. Introduction of a trigger compound does not alter the structure of the films but slightly increases the bilayer thickness. The SXR measurements of the floating monolayers also support the suggested immiscibility of the two components in the films."
"We study the structure and elastic properties of the bi-heterocyclic azo compound at the air-water interface through surface pressure (π)-area (A) isotherm recording followed by transferring them on hydrophilic and hydrophobic Si surfaces by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition method. A substantial change in the area/molecule is observed as a function of subphase pH and temperature. Such parameters strongly influence intramolecular interactions within azo molecules and the interactions between azo molecules and water that manifested in higher surface activity at low temperature and high pH, which in turn modifies the elasticity of azo assembly at the air-water interface. A large pH-dependent hysteresis with negative change in entropy, indicating molecular rearrangements, is observed. Molecular assembly formed at the air-water interface is then transferred onto hydrophilic and hydrophobic Si surfaces at two different surface pressures (5 and 30 mN/m) by the LB technique. The structural analysis performed by X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy techniques suggests that the LB films exhibit an abrupt layered structure on hydrophilic Si, whereas an overall rough film is formed on hydrophobic Si. The coverage and compactness of individual layers are found to increase with the deposition pressure (5 to 30 mN/m)."

"Magnetic Langmuir–Blodgett films of ferritin have been prepared by using the adsorption properties of a 1/4 mixed monolayer of eicosylamine (EA) and methyl stearate (SME). BAM images show that a more homogeneous distribution of ferritin at the air–water interface is achieved by using this mixture of surfactants instead of the DODA/SME mixed matrix of a previous work. Transfer of the monolayer onto different substrates allowed the preparation of multilayer LB films. Infrared and UV–Vis spectroscopies indicate that ferritin molecules are incorporated within the LB films. Furthermore, UV–Vis spectroscopy measurements reveal that the amount of ferritin incorporated into these LB film has been increased with respect to that in the DODA/SME LB films. Finally magnetic measurements confirm that the superparamagnetic properties of this molecule are preserved in the LB films."

"A new model by the authors ( J. Chem. Phys., 1991) has been applied to interpret binary ionic composition data obtained by Deamer et al. ( J. Lipid Res., 1967) for stearic acid monolayers with group IIA ions (Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+). Comparisons of the model predictions with those by previous electrochemical or thermodynamic models are made. Ion association equilibrium constants and Flory-Huggins mixing parameters have been determined. The model is then extended to ternary ionic systems, such as with H+, Ca2+, and Cd2+. Results for both binary and ternary systems show that the mixing of adsorbed ions in the monolayer plays a critical role in controlling the ionic compositions of Langmuir monolayers and subsequently produced Langmuir-Blodgett films."
"Strong interaction at the molecular level has been observed in Langmuir monolayers of polyaniline and a biphosphinic ruthenium complex, named Rupy. The area per molecule and maximum surface potential for the mixed films varied non linearly with the relative concentration of Rupy. Y-type Langmuir-Blodgett films have been deposited from the mixtures. Upon increasing the amount of Rupy, the LB films become increasingly oxidized, causing a blue shift in the peak attributed to the quinoid species of the PANI UV-visible spectra."
"Biological mineralization leads to the development of finely scaled, highly controlled inorganic precipitates in organic matrixes. It was initially thought that this control was mainly exercised through lattice-matching epitaxy between the protein or polysaccharide matrix and the mineral. We discuss the importance of such heterogeneous nucleation versus other forms of kinetic control of mineralization. We review progress in synthetic systems for mineralization from solution at Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir−Blodgett films, at surface-adsorbed monolayers and in polymer films."
"Recent advances in several experimental techniques have enabled detailed structural information to be obtained for floating (Langmuir) monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films. These techniques are described briefly and their application to the study of films of fatty acids and their salts is discussed. Floating monolayers on aqueous subphases have been shown to possess a complex polymorphism with phases whose structures may be compared to those of smectic mesophases. However, only those phases that exist at high surface pressures are normally used in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition. In single LB monolayers of fatty acids and fatty acid salts the acyl chains are in the all-trans conformation with their long axes normal to the substrate. The in-plane molecular packing is hexagonal with long-range bond orientational order and short-range positional order: known as the hexatic-B structure. This structure is found irrespective of the phase of the parent floating monolayer. The structures of multilayer LB films are similar to the structures of their bulk crystals, consisting of stacked bilayer lamellae. Each lamella is formed from two monolayers of fatty acid molecules or ions arranged head to head and held together by hydrogen bonding between pairs of acids or ionic bonding through the divalent cations. With acids the acyl chains are tilted with respect to the substrate normal and have a monoclinic structure, whereas the salts with divalent cations may have the chains normal to the substrate or tilted. The in-plane structures are usually centred rectangular with the chains in the trans conformation and packed in a herringbone pattern. Multilayer films of the acids show only a single-step order-disorder transition at the melting point. This temperature tends to rise as the number of layers increases. Complex changes occur when multilayer films of the salts are heated. Disorder of the chains begins at low temperatures but the arrangement of the head groups does not alter until the melting temperature is reached. Slow heating to a temperature just below the melting temperature gives, with some salts, a radical change in phase. The lamellar structure disappears and a new phase consisting of cylindrical rods lying parallel to the substrate surface and stacked in a hexagonal pattern is formed. In each rod the cations are aligned along the central axis surrounded by the disordered acyl chains."
"Discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) are considered as fascinating systems due to their unique property of self-assembly to yield different columnar structures. DLCs are organic semiconductors and create pathways for the development of numerous optical and electrical devices. The thin films of DLCs can be considered as low dimensional system which can exhibit remarkable optical and physical properties. In this article, we present a review on ultrathin films of some interesting DLC molecules at air–water and air–solid interfaces. The Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir–Blodgett films of DLC molecules are extensively studied. The ultrathin films of DLC molecules can yield highly anisotropic layer wherein the molecular orientation and aggregation can have large impact on the physicochemical properties of the film. Different surface phases with different molecular orientations as function of surface density and temperature can be obtained by forming the Langmuir monolayer of the DLC molecules at the air–water interface. The Langmuir monolayer in a particular phase can be deposited onto the active area of a device layer-by-layer by employing a highly controlled Langmuir–Blodgett technique. Here, we report some interesting results related on molecular orientation of the DLC molecules at different interfaces. Such aggregation of DLC molecules in ultrathin films may find applications in thin film-based electro-optical devices."
"The electrostatic binding and metal coordination between metal ions and Langmuir monolayers or LB films are discussed, and their effects on the monolayer 2D structure and related phase behavior are analyzed. The interfacial recognition and sensing for metal ions by Langmuir monolayers are also shown. Langmuir monolayers and LB films as 2D template to induce the 2D-oriented crystal growth via metal/monolayer binding is especially demonstrated. The abnormal catalytic characteristics, the functions and devices of metal-incorporated Langmuir monolayers and LB films are displayed by some examples. The review also shows the application of metal-chelating lipid monolayers on the interfacial study of bio-macromolecules. The review suggests the great roles of metal/monolayer binding in alternating monolayer structures and the assembly of functional metal complexes."
"The monolayer properties of amphiphilic cyclopalladated ferrocenylimine 1 on the ultrapure water surface were studied by using the surface pressure( π)- area( A) isotherm measurements. The π- A isotherms of complex 1 exhibited characteristic behaviors depending on the subphase temperature,concentration of the spreading solution,the compression speed and the time that a monolayer remained in its uncompressed state. The results indicated that high subphase temperature,dilute spreading solution,long time between spreading and compression,low compression speed probably leading to some decomposition of the aggregates of complex 1 formed in the chloroform solution contributed to obtained highly condensed and true floating monolayer. The linear relationship between the number of layers and the maximal absorbance in the UV- vis spectra of LB films showed that under the optimized conditions,the highly condensed and true floating monolayer was formed on the ultrapure water surface,and the monolayer was successfully deposited onto solid substrates."
"Oxidation of unsaturated lipids promotes important changes in the lipid packing or phase separation in cellular membranes or membrane models. Here, we study by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) the behavior of oxidized lipids in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films by using two strategies : either following the evolution of LB films of POPC (palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) naturally ageing in contact of atmospheric oxygen, or incorporating a known amount of a defined oxidized derivative of POPC (ALDO-PC) in POPC monolayers before their LB transfer.\nAFM images of naturally ageing POPC LB films show the appearance of small circular domains after 2 days of exposure to air. These domains (not observed if the samples are kept under vacuum) are characterized by a higher thickness (+0.8 nm) as compared to the intact POPC regions, likely due to a reversal of the oxidized chain which is more polar that intact hydrophobic chains. In the second case, surface pressure measurements show that ALDO-PC induces a slight expansion of the mixed monolayers, suggesting that they are rather homogenous. This hypothesis is confirmed by their smooth and homogenous AFM images. Finally, these results confirm that oxidation in POPC LB films occurs locally in areas presenting likely a looser packing or a defect."
"We investigate a strategy for producing organic NLO materials with high chromophore densities by assembling Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett films containing mixtures of two hyperpolarizable chromophore amphiphiles. When deposited at an air–water interface, the amphiphilic molecules are oriented with their molecular hyperpolarizabilities aligned, and their dipole moments antialigned. We find that mixed chromophore Langmuir monolayers are more stable than pure ones, suggesting that electrostatic interactions aid self-assembly and ordering. Upon transfer of the monolayers to glass and silicon substrates, aggregates with well-defined topological features appear. We characterize aggregate formation using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and nonlinear optical ellipsometry, and we propose a mechanism for aggregate formation. Understanding molecular interactions between strong chromophores should enable fabrication strategies that prevent aggregation and optimize chromophore alignment. Overall, our results suggest that electrostatic forces can be successfully applied to the assembly of the chromophores within bulk nonlinear optical materials containing densely packed, highly ordered, mixed chromophore systems."

"Development and study of novel biomimetic and biocompatible nano-engineered functional nanofilm\nmaterials are currently important from fundamental and applied viewpoints [1]. Such nanomaterials can \nserve as model systems for insight into the basic structural-functional interconnections at the nano-scale in \nbiological membranes and are useful for bio-medical applications including controlled drug delivery. \nWe present results of a study of novel nanofilm structures (Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett\nfilms) formed by functional amphiphilic amines and their interfacial complexes with colloid nanoparticles\nand polyelectrolytes including DNA. It was found that stearoylspermine molecules form stable Langmuir \nmonolayer on an aqueous subphase surface. The stearylspermine Langmuir monolayer compression \nisotherm changes caused by interactions of the monolayer with aqueous subphase components (colloid \nligand-free magnetite nanoparticles and DNA molecules) have been studied. The observed characteristic \nchanges in Langmuir monolayer compression isotherms indicated to the binding of nanoparticles and \npolyanions with cationic stearoylspermine monolayer. Monolayer LB films of interfacial polycomplexes \nformed by stearylspermine and magnetite nanoparticles or DNA molecules were deposited onto the mica \nsubstrate surface and the structure of obtained films was investigated using AFM technique. \nThe Langmuir monolayers and deposited LB films of the other type of functional amine-containing \ncompounds which are pH-sensitive synthetic lipids have been also studied. In our work the pH-sensitive \nlipid trans-4,5,didodecyloxycarbonyl- trans-2-morpholinocyclohexanol was synthesized and studied. We \nhave found the substantial changes of the Langmuir monolayer compression isotherm shape of that lipid \ncaused by the change in aqueous subphase pH value from 7.5 to 5. Those changes can be the result of pH-\ninduced conformational changes in the pH-sensitive lipid molecule. Corresponding monolayer LB films were \ndeposited on mica substrate and studied using AFM technique. The various pH-dependent structural \nfeatures including surface micelles were observed in the LB films deposited at various pH subphase values. \nThe investigated functional amine-containing compounds are promising candidates for many potential \napplications including formation of liposomal vesicles for encapsulation and controlled release, DNA and \ndrug delivery, formation of functional coatings on various substrate surfaces, etc."
"The amphiphilic block copolymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-Ge(C6F5)2-poly(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) was prepared by the reaction of chain transfer to bis-(pentafluorophenyl)germane during the polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and the subsequent postpolymerization of isolated functional polymers in 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate. The conversion of the block copolymer was 68% and the molecular weight of the sample was 490,000 g/mol. The colloidal chemical properties of Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films of synthesized block copolymer have been studied. For comparison, a functional polymer, namely, poly-N-isopropylacrylamide with terminal -Ge(C6F5)2H group, was synthesized and studied. The concentrations of spreading solutions were selected and the effect of subphase acidity on the formation of monolayers of macromolecules of the block copolymer was studied. It was found that regardless of the acidity of the subphase, high pressure of fracture of films are characteristic of monolayers of collapse pressures πmax = (48-61) mN/m. The morphology of the Langmuir-Blodgett films of functional polymer exhibit isolated elongated micelles with high densities in the form of "octopus" on the periphery of which there are terminal hydrophobic groups. For the Langmuir-Blodgett film of block copolymer, a comb-like structure is observed with characteristic protrusions."
"The capability of self-assembly and molecular recognition of biomolecules is essential for many nanotechnological applications, as in the use of alkyl-modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides to increase the cellular uptake of DNA and RNA. In this study, we show that a lipophilic nucleoside, which is an isomer mixture of 2'-palmitoyluridin und 3'-palmitoyluridin, forms Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films as a typical amphiphile, though with a smaller elasticity. The nucleoside may be incorporated into dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC) monolayers that serve as a simplified cell membrane model. The molecular-level interactions between the nucleoside and DPPC led to a remarkable condensation of the mixed monolayer, which affected both surface pressure and surface potential isotherms. The morphology of the mixed monolayers was dominated by the small domains of the nucleoside. The mixed monolayers could be deposited onto solid substrates as a one-layer Langmuir Blodgett film that displayed UV-vis absorption spectra typical of aggregated nucleosides owing to the interaction between the nucleoside and DPPC. The formation of solid films with DNA building blocks in the polar heads may open the way for devices and sensors be produced to exploit their molecular recognition properties."
"Fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (F-POSS) due to their nanoscale hybrid structure coupled with hydrophobic substituted chains have drawn significant attention as highly hydrophobic and oleophobic materials. That is why the surface properties of such compounds at the molecular level should be analyzed in details. Therefore we studied four different fluorinated closed cage polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) using Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) techniques. The monolayer behavior was investigated by measurements of the surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherm and morphology of the films was visualized using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). The rheological behavior was investigated using interfacial shear rheometer (ISR). The unusual properties of these silsesquioxanes result from their unsymmetrical structure. The hydrophobic character of their fluorinated substituents, combined with the hydrophilicity of the trimethoxysilane moieties lead to specific monolayer properties. The compounds were found to form stable monolayers at the air/water (A/W) interface however the surface activity of POSS derivatives decreases with increasing content of fluorinated moieties in the POSS structure. The monolayers of the studied POSS compounds were also successfully transferred onto the solid substrates as Y-type Langmuir-Blodgett films. The wettability and the structure of the LB film were investigated by measuring the static water contact angle on the glass surface. The presence of fluorinated moieties in the structure of POSS molecules governs the enhanced hydrophobic properties of solid substrate modified by the LB film."

"Abstract The ordering in liquid crystals (LCs) can be influenced by an interface. Some of these molecules adsorbed at the air‐water interface yield a stable Langmuir monolayer. They exhibit numerous surface phases, which are classified on the basis of intermolecular separation and ordering. These surface phases are governed by the molecular interactions and the ambient experimental conditions such as temperature, humidity, pH, and ion content of the subphase. In this article, the role of molecular interactions on the surface behavior of several rodlike LCs are discussed. The Langmuir monolayer of a cholesteric LC exhibits an interesting low density liquid ( L 1′ ) phase with tilted molecules. Brewster angle microscopy reveals stripe patterns, which arise due to the precession of the tilted molecules. It is demonstrated that this molecular precession can be controlled by the relative humidity, presence of cations in the subphase, and incorporation of appropriate molecular species. The Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir‐Blodgett films of a novel rod‐disc hybrid LC are discussed."
"The spontaneous growth of helical fibers of amphiphilic diamide derivatives containing hydrocarbons with asymmetric carbon centers in their constituent hydrocarbons was investigated. 12-Hydroxystearic acid and a gemini-type surfactant obtained by the bimolecular condensation of this compound with hexamethylenediamine both impart thixotropic ability to a solvent. Although this thixotropic behavior is based on the growth of hierarchical crystalline nanofibers in the solvents, the degree of fiber growth itself was not the origin of the thixotropy. In this study, it has adopted the methods of the Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir–Blodgett films as technique to selectively and individually evaluate the behavior of 12-hydroxyl stearyl and/or stearyl chains themselves. The ability to impart thixotropy to the solvent via fiber organization was related to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the added amphiphiles. Additionally, homogeneous right-handed helical fibers were formed in the spin-cast films of the diamide derivatives, and a positive Cotton effect was observed in their circular dichroism spectra. It is suggested that fibers that do not form helical arrangements cannot impart sufficient thixotropy to the solvent even when extensive fiber growth is achieved, and the structure-dependent development of chirality is the driving force. In addition, to further the development of highly functional thixotropic agents, a trefoil-like triamide derivative containing three chains was synthesized. By using this molecule, solvent gelation occurred at 78% as an addition to the diamide case, and a supramolecular assembly was formed in the corresponding two-dimensional film."

"A series of water soluble, surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs), namely, 1-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium chlorides ([Cn -mim]Cl) and their mixtures with palmitic acid (PA) are investigated in Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films. It is inferred from the surface pressure-area isotherms that C16 -mim-IL mixes non-ideally with PA and stabilizes the binary mixed films. In addition, the residence of mim-IL at the water surface is enhanced as a function of the increasing alkyl side chain length. Generally, the compressional moduli values decrease upon increasing the content of the mim-ILs over a wide range of compositions. Furthermore, film relaxation measurements indicate that the IL component is selectively excluded from the mixed films upon achieving a certain target pressure. Brewster angle microscope images demonstrate minimal changes on the PA domains in the presence of either C4 - and C8 -mim-ILs, whereas presence of the hexadecyl counterpart results in the formation of condensed sheets. Atomic force microscopy imaging of deposited films show the formation of propeller-like aggregates when C8 - or C16 -mim-IL is present in the mixed films."
"The synthesis of amphiphilic diblock copolypeptides consisting of poly(α-l-glutamic acid) (PLGA) and poly(γ-methyl-l-glutamate-ran-γ-stearyl-l-glutamate) with 30 mol % of stearyl substituents (PMLGSLG) and their monolayer behavior at the air–water interface have been studied. PLGA-b-PMLGSLG was synthesized via a diblock copolymer precursor consisting of poly(γ-tert-butyl-l-glutamate) (PtBuLG) and PMLGSLG blocks, with the tert-butyl group as a mild acid-labile protecting group for the carboxylic acid. The polymerization conditions were found to influence the α-helix to β-sheet content ratio and can be tuned to significantly enhance the diblock copolypeptide helicity. Purely α-helical PtBuLG-b-PMLGSLG diblock copolymers were successfully prepared. After removal of the tert-butyl group, the study of the PLGA-b-PMLGSLG amphiphilic diblock copolymers in Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett films demonstrated the formation of a stable α-helical double-brush structure, with the helices tilted away from the substrate surface. These double-brush monolayers combine the unique properties arising from the unidirectionally aligned helix macrodipole and the liquid-like features of the side chain mantle of the PMLGSLG block. Such systems are promising for thin film applications requiring incorporation and orientation of bio- and optical molecules."
"Porphyrins are currently used in photodynamic therapy as photosensitizers. In this paper we studied the interaction of two charged porphyrins, 5, 10, 15, 20-mesotetrakis(N-metyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin, (TMPyP/chloride salt) cationic, and 5, 10, 15, 20-meso-tetrakis(sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin, (TPPS4/sodium salt) anionic, nanoassembled in phospholipid Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films. Furthermore, we used chitosan to mediate the interaction between the porphyrins and the model membrane, aiming to understand the role of the polysaccharide in a molecular level. The effect of the interaction of the photosensitizers on the fluidity of the lipid monolayer was investigated by using dilatational surface elasticity. We also used photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to identify the porphyrins adsorbed in the phospholipid films. We observed an expansion of the monolayer promoted by the adsorption of the porphyrins into the lipid-air interface which was more pronounced in the case of TMPyP, as a consequence of a strong electrostatic interaction with the anionic monolayer. The chitosan promoted a higher adsorption of the porphyrins on the phospholipid monolayers and enabled the porphyrin to stay in its monomeric form (as confirmed by PL spectroscopy), thus demonstrating that chitosan can be pointed out as a potential photosensitizer delivery system in photodynamic therapy."
"Eight new oligomeric mesogens are reported, consisting of an azobenzene-based core attached to which are four 4-cyanobiphenyl units via flexible alkyl spacers (n = 5–12). Their chemical structures were determined by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermotropic liquid crystalline properties of these materials were investigated by POM, DSC and XRD. The oligomers containing n = 8 and n = 10 were found to exhibit a monotropic nematic (N) phase while others were non-mesomorphic. Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett films of the nematic compounds (n = 10) were studied at the air–water interface (Langmuir film) and the air–solid interface. Surface manometry studies on the Langmuir monolayer showed that the film had nearly zero surface pressure at a large area per molecule (Am ≥ 0.55 nm2). The film on compression showed a gradual increase in surface pressure and finally collapsed at an Am of about 0.15 nm2 with a collapse pressure of about 60 mN m−1. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images (during compression) showed that dark regions coexisting with grey spots in large areas transformed to a uniform grey region with an increase in surface density and finally collapsed exhibiting bright regions. Atomic force microscopy studies (AFM) on the LB films, transferred onto freshly cleaved hydrophilic mica substrates, exhibited a network of thin fibers with the height of fibers varying between ∼4 nm to 80 nm which could be due to π–π stacking and dipolar interactions associated with the cyanobiphenyl units. On a hydrophobic silicon substrate, the LB transfer yielded a multilayer film which dewetted to form nanodroplets. We carried out temperature dependent AFM studies of the nematic compounds which showed the reversible formation of aligned fibers (∼20 to 40 μm) in the mesophase. In brief, our study provides new approaches for the realization of controlling the anisotropic properties of an ordered phase."
"Present communication reports the micellar effect on the increased fluorescence efficiency of a fluorescent dye in the complex LB film. In the complex Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir-Blodgett films, anionic Xanthene dye molecules organized differently when the films were prepared below and above the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) in the mixed solution of the Langmuir Trough. In-situ Brewster Angle Microscopic (BAM) studies showed the visual images of the Langmuir monolayers during the formation of the films. UV–Vis absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopic studies were employed to study the spectral characteristics of the complex films."
"Abstract This work reports the formation of stable Langmuir monolayer of an anionic water soluble fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (abbreviated as CFS) by electrostatic interaction with a cationic monolayer. Formation of non-fluorescent H-dimeric sites of CFS molecules in Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir Blodgett films has been controlled by using cationic surfactant micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Thus the film can act as efficient fluorescence marker. Langmuir monolayer has been investigated by Surface Pressure versus Area per molecule ( π -A) isotherm and in situ Brewster Angle Microscope (BAM) studies. Mono and multilayered Langmuir Blodgett films were characterized by using UV–vis absorption and steady state fluorescence spectroscopy."
"A synthetic peptidolipid consisted of a hydrocarbon chain with a chain length of C18 and a peptide moiety of IIGLM terminated with an amine group, designated as C18IIGLM-NH2, has been employed as a biomimic model compound of amyloid peptide for exploring molecular interaction and orientation with the use of the Langmuir monolayer and Langmuir-Blodgett film techniques. Inspired by a well-known fact that a stain reagent, Congo red (CR), binds well to the amyloid-mimic part (IIGLM), inhibition of molecular aggregation of C18IIGLM-NH2 by interaction with CR was expected, and it has been investigated by use of surface pressure-area isotherm, surface dipole moment-area isotherm, Brewster-angle microscopy, and UV-vis/infrared spectroscopies. It has been revealed that monomeric CR molecules whose long axis is parallel to the Langmuir monolayer surface are penetrating the C18IIGLM-NH2 Langmuir monolayer, which plays a role of inhibition of molecular aggregation via hydrogen bonding."
"The formation and structure of Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films were studied using water-soluble polymers, which have difficulty forming monolayers on the water surface, and polymers that are insoluble in all solvents. The network copolymers consisting of hyperbranched units with an s-benzenetricarbamide core used in this study can be freely controlled by azidation/non-azidation of both ends of the hard segment. The water-soluble copolymer, which exhibits the properties of a thermoplastic resin, can form a monolayer when spread on the water surface at a low temperature at which the solubility decreases. Even when the subphase temperature increased, no significant change in the monolayer behavior of the thermoplastic copolymer was observed. This behavior was attributed to the formation of an insoluble single-particle layer with hydrophilic groups facing inward on the water surface. The insoluble copolymer, which exhibits thermosetting properties, forms a tablet that floats on the water surface for an extended period. The surface pressure-time isotherms showed the formation of a monolayer from the tablet over time, and it was possible to measure the surface pressure-area isotherms by two-dimensional compression after a certain period of time."
"Matrix vesicles are a special class of extracellular vesicles contributing to both physiologic and pathologic biomineralization. Biomimetic models, including proteoliposomes, Langmuir monolayers, and Langmuir–Blodgett films, have been used to assess the biochemical and functional properties of matrix vesicles. Proteoliposomes can reproduce the spherical geometry and the lipid and protein content of matrix vesicles. Mimicking the function and membrane organization of natural vesicles, proteoliposomes can provide insights into the mechanisms of matrix vesicle-mediated calcification. Moreover, although Langmuir monolayers and Langmuir–Blodgett films cannot reproduce the spherical geometry of the vesicles, they are useful for determining the thermodynamic parameters of lipid–lipid and lipid–protein interactions. In this chapter, we will describe the use of biomimetic models to shed light on the role of proteins already described in the proteome of matrix vesicles, including tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1), and members of the annexin family, in the biomineralization processes."
