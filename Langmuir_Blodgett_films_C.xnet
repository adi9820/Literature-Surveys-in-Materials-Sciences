"The goal of this work is the preparation of monolayers of cellulose I nanocrystals providing flat crystalline cellulose surfaces. Suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals were prepared by hydrolyzing ramie and tunicin fibers with sulfuric acid. Due to surface grafted sulfate groups, the negatively charged, rod-like cellulose nanocrystals were found to form stable layers at the air–water interface in the presence of a cationic amphiphilic molecule such as dioctadecyldimethylammonium (DODA) used in this work. These layers were formed at different cellulose–DODA weight ratios, compressed and analyzed by tensiometry, ellipsometry and Brewster angle microscopy. At low cellulose concentrations the layers are discontinuous, becoming dense and homogeneous upon reaching a critical weight ratio, which depends on the aspect ratio of the cellulose nanocrystals. After transfer onto silicon wafers, the surface composition and morphology as well as the thickness of the films were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The results indicate that they are monolayer films, well structured, relatively smooth and pure. These films offer a crystalline and easily reproducible model cellulose surface."
"An extended model of flow orientation has been developed for analyzing the inplane anisotropy in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films by taking into account the viscoelastic nature of a condensed monolayer at the air-water interface as a Bingham plasticity. The model is based on a two-dimensional fluid and a line-sink as representing the monolayer and the substrate, respectively. The predictions from the present model with respect to the dichroic behavior have been experimentally verified employing a mixed LB system of a merocyanine dye and a fatty acid. The model is also consistent with the remarks from ESR line-shape analysis reported previously and those from analysis of the optical absorption spectra using the extended dipole theory. These results show that the inner stress due to the velocity gradient in the monolayer during the deposition is the origin of the in-plane anisotropy."
"A kinetic study of the thermal decay of the red-shifted bands of dye-containing Langmuir-Blodgett films was carried out for three different merocyanines. The decay process was traced by repeated application of a cycle consisting of spectral measurements, heating at a constant temperature for a given time and then cooling to room temperature. For one of the three dyes the red-shifted band was found to be restored on cooling, while for the other two the spectral changes were quenched. This irreversible decay behaviour is characterized as a first-order rate process with values of the frequency factor τ−10 and the activation energy W of 1011–1015 s−1 and 1.1−1.3 eV respectively. The values of W are much smaller than the photon energy hv ∼ 2 eV for the absorption maxima of the bands or the dissociation energy of the chemical bonds, indicating that the present decay process is a steric rearrangement of chromophores."
"A model of flow orientation has been developed for analyzing the dichroism in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films by introducing a two-dimensional fluid and a sink, which represent the monolayer and a substrate, respectively. The angular distribution function derived using the velocity gradient given by the ideal-fluid approximation satisfactorily explains the data of dichroism in the mixed LB films of a dye and a fatty acid prepared with different velocities. The results are consistent also with those of the line-shape analysis of ESR spectrum reported previously."

"Schottky and p-n junction diodes were fabricated from Langmuir-Blodgett films based on merocyanine and triphenylmethane dye derivatives. The photovoltage was observed and the spectral dependence of the photocurrent was measured. The diodes exhibit essentially the same behaviour as the corresponding evaporated dye film diodes in spite of the presence of inert hydrocarbon chains in the dye-sensitized Langmuir-Blodgett films."
"The effects of acid and basic vapour phase treatments (AT and BT respectively) have been studied on Langmuir-Blodgett films thicker than 9 monolayers of a merocyanine (DI) and its 6-CH3, substituted product (DII). Optical measurements indicate that the red-shifted (J-like) band structure, which is dissociated on AT as well as by heat treatment, can be restored by applying BT. A polymorphism is seen for DI among the as-deposited and the restored J-like structures. The absence of polymorphism for DII indicates a stereospecific role of the 6-CH3 group in the chromophore aggregation. The lateral photoconductivity Δσ| is controlled in a range of nearly two decades by these treatments and their combinations. The largest Δσ| is attained by a successive application AT → BT."
"Photoelectric characteristics of heterogeneous Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film diodes have been studied using mixed monolayers of surfactant derivatives of semiconducting dyes and arachidic acid (C20). The current-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves measured were qualitatively the same as those of amorphous dye devices. Evaluation of the photoelectron decay range showed that the dye chromophore modifies the LB films to act as electron transport layers. A simple model is proposed, which assumes the formation of energy bands at the chromophore-containing interfaces and shows an analogy between the LB film diodes and amorphous organic devices. With this model, the loss of photoelectrons at an unmodified interface of C20 is evaluated as 28% and 52% for the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions, respectively."
"Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of a surfactant squarylium were prepared to investigate formation of H aggregates, which are characterized by blue-shifted sharp absorption bands. The LB films showed an aging effect in room temperature, and annealing was effective to promote H-aggregate formation. Photovoltaic cells of an Al/LB film/Ag structure were also fabricated to investigate the effect of H-aggregate formation for photoelectric conversion. Unlike the case in J-aggregate LB films, action spectra of the photocurrent in the cells were similar to the absorption spectra of the H-aggregate LB films, that is, the H bands can effectively contribute to the photocurrent. The aggregate formation seems to influence the nonradiative decay of excited dyes on metals by coupling with surface plasmon polaritons, which affects the efficiency of photoelectric conversion."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films are constructed by successively transferring monomolecular layers formed at the air–water interface onto solid substrates. One of the advantages of the LB technique in fabricating molecular aggregates lies in the fact that it can employ various kinds of molecules by mixing them at the air–water interface. The mixed system may exhibit new properties that are not observed for individual components. This method would be useful, for example, in the studies of the formation and control of the J-aggregates of functional dyes that attract attention both in science and technology. In this paper, I review this subject mainly based on our recent results in merocyanines. LB films of merocyanine dyes, mixed with arachidic acid (C20), exhibit J-aggregate formation and have been serving as typical systems in revealing the physical and structural aspects of nanosized molecular aggregates constructed as monolayers. In the case of LB films of a merocyanine dye having benzothiazole as donor nucleus (abbreviated as DS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has been successful in determining the characteristic in-plane orientation of dye molecules with respect to the dipping direction, which led to the discovery of the flow orientation effect during the dipping process of LB films as the origin of optical dichroism often observed in LB films. In this article, after an introduction of ESR spectroscopy, three major topics on the merocyanine J-aggregation and its characterization in mixed films are discussed. The first topic is the observation and control of the size of J-aggregates in the dilution limit of dyes in arachidic acid matrix for a methyl-substituted DS (6-Me-DS). Dependence of atomic force microscopy (AFM) patterns on the molar ratio allows the identification of dye domains. J-band optical peak analysis based on the Kuhn's extended dipole model, supplemented by a novel application of femtosecond pump-probe optical spectroscopy, yields the size of the J-aggregates of 103. The second topic is the control of the J-band peak wavelengths by mixing two different kinds of dye molecules. The first case is the mixture of a J-forming 6-Me-DS and non-J-forming merocyanine analog, DO with benzo-oxazole instead of benzothiazole of DS. The second case is the mixture of both J-forming dyes but with different J-band peak positions, 6-Me-DS and another analog of 5-Cl-DS. The optical peak shifts depending on the molar mixing ratio will be presented. The last topic is related to the elucidation of electronic states of dye molecules in the J-aggregates. Light-induced ESR (LESR) of DS films with stable isotope (15N or 13C)-substituted dyes provide clear evidence for the photoinduced charge transfer by the detection of hyperfine structures. Moreover, infrared (IR) spectroscopy of 13C-enriched dye identifies the IR absorption peak of the relevant carbon in the chromophore. The results give evidence for the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer of dyes in the J-aggregates compared with an isolated merocyanine composed of donor and acceptor moiety. Lastly, the Cl attachment in 5-Cl-DS leads to a significant enhancement of the nitrogen hyperfine coupling in the LESR spectra. These examples and others demonstrate the potential of LB films of merocyanines in the studies of the nanosized molecular aggregates in monolayer assemblies."

"Interface-adsorbed complex Langmuir-Blodgett films of aradicic acid and a cyanine dye were fabricated using the diffusion-adsorption method. Their optical properties were examined employing a linearly polarized incident. The film show a large in-plane anisotropy of the optical density and spectral shape. The origin of the anisotropy is explained plausibly by assuming flow orientation and Davydov splitting. The configuration of the dye molecules was estimated using the extended dipole model."
"The changes in the in-plane spectral anisotropy caused by heat, acidic vapour and basic vapour treatments after deposition are studied for Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of merocyanine dye containing a benzoselenazole nuclei mixed with arachidic acid. The as-deposited films exhibit a J-like aggregate band at 597 nm which is strongly polarized along the dipping direction of the substrate. After heat treatment or HCl vapour treatment, the J-like band disappears and the in-plane spectral anisotropy is reduced. NH3 vapour treatment causes the J-like band to be restored in the wavelength region 620–627 nm. The restored J-like band is polarized along the same direction as the original J-like band. This memory effect of chromophore orientation suggests that there is a highly anisotropic structure of J-like aggregates in LB films."
"The present status of research on Langmuir Blodgett (LB) films in Japan is outlined in relation to molecular engineering. Stress is laid on the fundamentals of LB films: synthesis of novel films, advances in preparation techniques, and characterization of molecular domains. The novel LB films developed recently include those with high conductivity, those of wholly aromatic compounds, those of photoconductive dyes and those having a triad of three different functional groups. The preparation techniques include horizontal lifting, a method of depositing monolayers with the minimum shearing stress, the formation and deposition of supermonomolecular layers, and secondary treatments for modifying the properties of films. The advances in characterization are exemplified by the introduction of Penning ionization electron spectroscopy, the utilization of synchrotron radiation and analyses using the electron spin resonance technique applied to dye LB films and conducting LB films. The prospects for molecular engineering in the near future are briefly discussed. The significance of the LB technique as a tool for fabricating test structures is pointed out together with the increasing importance of theoretical guidelines."
"We have studied the blue-shifted and the red-shifted bands formed in mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films of the merocyanine dye (MS)-arachidic acid (C20)-n-octadecane (AL18) ternary system with the molar mixing ratio [MS]:[C20]:[AL18]=1:2:x(0.5≦x≦5.0). The formation of the blue-shifted and the red-shifted bands depends on the AL18 content, and shows that the aggregation state can be modulated by changing the AL18 content. The observed overlapping spectra of the blue-shifted and the red-shifted bands are deconvoluted into two original bands. The extended dipole model has been applied to examine the aggregation state of MS referring to the deconvoluted spectra. Thus the estimated minimum aggregation number Nmin and the slip angle α between the long axis of the aggregate and the transition dipole moment are Nmin=40 and α=30° and Nmin=40 and α=50° for fully-developed J- and H-aggregates, respectively, seen for x≦1.5, and Nmin tends to decrease with increasing x."
"ESR measurements were performed on Langmuir-Blodgctt (LB) films of merocyanine dyes, diluted with arachidic acid. Stable signal due to two radical species was detected and the spectra showed clear anisotropy both for the in-plane and out-of-plane of the film. Measurements at X- and Q-bands revealed that the in-plane structure of the spectra arises from the hyperfine splitting of a nitrogen nucleus of the dye molecule. Based on this fact, the anisotropic line shape was analyzed by a computer simulation and the angle between the preferred direction of p π orbital axis of the nitrogen atom and the dipping direction of the film was determined to be 60° to 65° in the film plane. A possible correlation between the obtained angle and the structure of the dye aggregates is discussed in relation to the intermolecular charge transfer model for the origin of the radicals."
"ESR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements were performed on Langmuir-Blodgett films of merocyanine dyes with two different donor nuclei, diluted with arachidic acid. The existence of oriented stable radical species was confirmed from the observed ESR and proton ENDOR spectra which showed clear anisotropies both in-plane and out-of-plane of the film. Heat treatment of the system, which destroys the J-aggregates of the dye molecules, brought an increase of spin concentration at the initial stage of heating, followed by a gradual decrease on further heating. Based on those facts, together with the observation of light-induced enhancement of ESR intensity, an intermolecular charge transfer in dye aggregates is proposed as the origin of the radical species."
"Schottky-type cells with a photoconductive layer made of merocyanine dye Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film were fabricated to investigate transient photocurrent properties of LB films. The laser pulse-induced transient photocurrent was deduced by differentiating the quasi-open-circuit voltage signal for security of the time resolution. The observed photocurrent showed a long time tail following an extremely rapid initial rise. The long time tail can be represented by a power-law dependence, which is regarded as evidence for dispersive conduction. The power-law decay seems to be reflecting a process limited to the interface between hydrophilic groups, where dye chromophores are located, since the properties are almost immune to change in the layer thickness."
"Malachite-green (MG) dye which does not contain a long alkyl chain can be adsorbed from aqueous solution onto Langmuir-Blodgett films consisting of arachidic acid (AR) only or a mixture of the acid and merocyanine (MC) dye. A special interaction exists between MC and MG molecules; MG molecules are more selectively adsorbed to MC molecules than to AR molecules. The adsorption Langmuir-Blodgett films show negative photoelectrical properties which are strongly related to the interaction between the two functional dyes."
"J aggregate formation of a merocyanine dye, 3-carboxymethyl-5-[2- (3-octadecyl-2(3H)-benzoselenazolinylidene)ethylidene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone, and the structural change on irradiation by laser light were investigated. The dye formed two types of J aggregates as well as monomer on the subphase depending on the species of metal ions. On the aqueous solution containing Ca2+, Ba2+ and Cd2+ ions J aggregates with γmax = 600–610 nm formed while on the aqueous solution containing other metal ions such as Na+, K+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Er3+ and Lu3+ J aggregates with γmax = 620–630 nm formed. Monolayer aggregates containing Ba2+ (former type) and Co2+ (latter type) were transferred onto substrates as X-type Langmuir-Blodgett films (LB1 and LB2 respectively). On irradiation by laser light with γ = 600±20 nm and a power density of 700 μW cm−2, the absorption spectra of both films changed dramatically owing to the dissociation of J aggregates. The dissociation was proved to proceed thermally. The rate constants for LB1 and LB2, assuming first-order reaction, were estimated to be 4.6 × 10-3 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−3 s−1 respectively. The apparent activation energy for B1 was estimated to be 7.5 kcal mol-1."

"A delocalization length and dimensionality of Frenkel excitons in 6-methyl merocyanine J-aggregates in Langmuir–Blodgett films have been investigated by means of linear and nonlinear absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum of dye molecules in an LB film shows the energy shift due to the formation of J-aggregates with respect to the transition energy of monomers. From the differential absorption spectra measured by the femtosecond pump and probe experiment, we have obtained exciton energies of the lowest and second lowest states in J-aggregates. Using both spectroscopic data and a dipole model of molecular arrangement, we have determined the exciton delocalization size of two-dimensional J-aggregates (26(±1)×40(±9) molecules)."
"The deposition of chlorophyll-a monolayers onto an SnO2 optically transparent electrode was studied in relation to the deposition ratio. The values of the deposition ratio, which were approximately 0.95 for the upward movement and very small but non-zero for the downward movement, suggest that the multilayers prepared are Z-type films containing a small fraction of the Y-type component corresponding to the non-zero value. This is consistent with the photo- electrochemical behaviour of the pigmented electrodes which is markedly dependent on the deposition ratios, indicating structural inhomogeneity or imperfection of the multilayers."
"Optical absorption and fluorescence, as well as electron spin resonance measurements were performed on Langmuir-Blodgett films of binary mixtures of three kinds of merocyanine dyes, i.e. DO, DS and DSe, where DS and DSe form J-like aggregates (but DO does not) in single-component films. The observed optical absorption spectra of mixed films were markedly dependent on the combination of dyes. [DS]1−x[DSe]x LB films show a sharp red-shifted J-like band peak over the entire concentration range. In contrast, the spectrum of the [DSe]1−x[DO]x system consists essentially of [DO]'s monomer peak and [DSe]'s J-like band peak, suggesting the presence of phase separation. In the [DS]1−x[DO]x system, a J-like band peak is maintained up to a composition that contains 70% DO. In particular, [DS]0.5[DO]0.5 film shows a sharp J-like absorption and a sharp J-band fluorescence peak, and a small Stokes shift is observed. These results suggest that most of the DO molecules associate to form J-like aggregates in the [DS]1−x[DO]x system."
"The flow orientation model has been extended to cases with arrays of substrates, asymmetric deposition, discontinuity in the monolayer and stretching of the monolayer. Predictions are derived as the guidelines for controlling the in-plane molecular orientation in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films prepared using the vertical dipping method. The conventionally prepared LB films are found to be inevitably associated with degradation in the edge region. The remedies for reducing the edge effect are shown on the basis of the present model. They are the use of cylindrical substrates within the framework of the conventional vertical dipping method, and the introduction of the horizontal lifting method and of the Kumehara-Miyata version of the vertical dipping method with moving walls."

"Electron spin resonance measurements are performed on Langmuir-Blodgett films of a merocyanine dye diluted with arachidic acid. Stable signals are detected and spectra show a clear anisotropy, where in-plane structures are found to exhibit hyperfine splitting owing to a nitrogen nucleus of the dye molecule, from the frequency dependence of the spectral line shape at the X and Q bands. Line shape analysis using a computer simulation determines the distribution of molecular orientations, where the pπ orbital axis of the molecule is nearly parallel to the film plane and makes an angle of about 60° with the dipping direction. This angle shows a correlation with the structure of J aggregate proposed by the optical analysis and the obtained in-plane distribution function explains the observed dichroic ratio of the J band well, suggesting that the radical is associated with the J aggregate. For the out-of-plane distribution, the molecules are found to be highly organized along the plane normal."
"Water-soluble cyanine dye derivatives can be adsorbed from aqueous solution to an arachidic acid monolayer at the air-water interface. Interface-adsorbed complex Langmuir–Blodgett films of arachidic acid and four different derivatives of thiacarbocyanine dyes were fabricated using this method, and their optical properties were examined employing a linearly polarized incident. Clear differences in both spectral shape and in-plane anisotropy were found among the films of different derivatives, each associated with an aggregate form characteristic of the substituent group. They can be classified as a dimer with Davydov splitting, a monomer, and a J aggregate. Estimation of the configuration of the molecules in the dimers and measurement of the photoluminescence spectrum for the J aggregate were performed to clarify the nature of aggregates. The results suggest the possibility of systematic control of aggregate formation in the system by introducing substituent groups for dyes."
"An H-like band, blue-shifted from an absorption maximum of a monomer band, has been formed in merocyanine–arachidic acid mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films by adding n-alkane species of different chain lengths (CH3(CH2)n−2CH3, n=18 and 28) as a third component. In each ternary system, the blue-shifted band is prominent or is accompanied by a J-band depending on the preparation conditions. The absorption spectra A‖ and A⊥ were measured using a normal incident of linearly polarized light with the electric vector either parallel or perpendicular to the dipping direction, respectively. The results of surface pressure–area isotherm measurements have indicated that the alkane species remaining in the monolayer and filling empty spaces near surface-active molecules act as the trigger molecules to induce the H-like aggregates. Comparing these results with the predictions from the theory of flow orientation and the extended dipole model, it is suggested that the present blue-shifted H-like band is of an H-aggregate rather than a dimer."

"An amphiphilic merocyanine dye, C18DS, forms J-aggregates in its Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films. In order to investigate the influence of the J-aggregation upon the electronic state of the dye, IR absorption spectra were observed for LB films of 13C-substituted C18DS, in which a carbon atom in the central conjugated system of the dye is replaced by 13C. Clear red shifts due to the 13C-substitution were observed for the IR bands that exhibit red shifts upon the J-aggregation. This result shows that these bands originate from stretching of central conjugated system, and then suggest an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer upon the J-aggregation. Frequency calculation using the density functional method was performed for C4DS, in which the octadecyl group of C18DS is truncated to a butyl group. The calculation results coincide with both the IR spectrum of C18DS and the 13C-substitution effect on it. The observed IR bands were assigned on the basis of this calculation."
"Aggregation of cyanine dyes within Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films is exploited to form heterodimers within mixed dye monolayers. The geometrical constraints imposed on the amphiphilic dye molecules within an LB monolayer are utilized to facilitate polarized energy transfer. Time-correlated single-photon counting is used to measure the residual polarization of electronic energy transfer from donor oxacyanine molecules to acceptor oxacarbocyanine molecules. The residual polarization decay profiles are fit to a biexponential and are contrasted for two types of LB matrixes. In a neutral tripalmitin LB matrix, the residual polarization of this mixed cyanine dye system is as high as 0.13 and decays with decay times of 170 ps and 2.8 ns to 0.03. In an ionic fatty acid LB matrix the residual polarization reaches 0.11 and decays to 0.06 with decay times of 620 ps and 5.3 ns. The concentration depolarization of these residual polarizations suggests that heterodimers are randomly distributed throughout the LB monolayer."
"Light-induced electron spin resonance in a Langmuir-Blodgett film of pure merocyanine dye with a long hydrocarbon chain has been observed clearly for the first time. When monochromatic light was irradiated on the dye film, the intensity of the electron spin resonance signal grew twice as compared with the dark one without irradiation. Its lifetime was found to be about 15 min. Also the light-induced signal in a Langmuir-Blodgett film of diluted dye has been detected and its lifetime was about 30 min."
"The layered structure in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the merocyanine dye (MS)-arachidic acid (C 20 ) binary system and the MS–C 20 - n -octadecane (AL 18 ) ternary system with low and high C 20 contents ([MS]: [C 20 ]:[AL 18 ]=1: 2: x and 1: 5: x , 0≦ x ≦5.0) has been studied by means of surface pressure (π)–area (A) isotherm and X-ray diffraction measurements. The π–A isotherm measurement indicates that AL 18 tends to fill the empty space of MS; however, a certain amount of AL 18 is found outside of the space of MS even for smaller mixing ratios of AL 18 . A phase transition is observed in the π–A isotherms of the ternary monolayers with low and high C 20 contents for x ≧3.0. Two different regimes can be recognized in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the LB films with low and high C 20 contents: 2θ&lt; 9° and 9° &lt; 2θ. The bilayer unit-cell species governing the X-ray diffraction patterns for 2θ&lt;9° changes with increasing molar mixing ratio of C 20 . X-ray diffraction and π–A isotherm measurements indicate that the increase in AL 18 in the empty space of MS causes the expansion of the spacing estimated for 2θ&lt; 9° in the LB films."
"We have demonstrated that the rotating-disk method, which was proposed by Mingotaud et al. [J. Phys. Chem. 99, 17 068 (1995)] recently, is effective to induce in-plane orientation in the Langmuir-Blodgett films of merocyanine dye--behenic acid mixtures. To clarify the orientation mechanism, the monolayer flow due to the disk has been observed directly and interpreted by an analytical model incorporating a non-Newtonian behavior of the films. Based on this observation, a steady-state orientation-distribution function has been calculated. The comparison of the calculated orientation-distribution function and the experimental data shows that our model gives a guideline of the rotating-disk method."
"Abstract Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film deposition gives an opportunity to control the packing density and orientation of anisotropic nanoparticles at a monolayer level, allowing accurate characterization of their anisotropic material properties. The uniaxial deposition of rod‐shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) over a macroscopically large area is achieved by aligning the long axis of CNCs on the LB trough with the direction of the maximum drag force within the meniscus during the vertical pulling of the substrate from the LB trough. On the uniaxially‐aligned LB films, anisotropic linear and non‐linear optical properties of CNCs are obtained using Mueller matrix spectroscopy and sum frequency generation spectroscopy, respectively, and explained with time‐dependent density functional theory calculations. Also, the frictional anisotropy of the LB film is measured using atomic force microscopy and explained theoretically. The findings of this study will be valuable for preparation of anisotropic nanoparticle thin films with uniform arrangements and utilization of their anisotropic material properties."
"Interface-adsorbed complex Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of arachidic acid and water-soluble, mesosubstituted cyanine dyes were fabricated using the diffusion-adsorption method to examine the substituent-dependent self-assembly at the water-monolayer interface. Either a J aggregate or an H aggregate was found to be formed in the LB films depending on the substituent introduced, the ethyl or methyl group. The H aggregate is accompanied by Davydov splitting, which is characterized as the split of the band into two bands, whose transition moments are orthogonal to each other. Measurements of photoluminescence and microscopic spectroscopy were performed to identify the type of the aggregates. The molecular arrangements in the aggregates were estimated based on Davydov’s theory and the extended dipole model. Dependence of photoelectric properties of the LB films on the type of aggregates has been studied employing Schottky-type cells."
"Resonance Raman (RR) spectra were measured for mono-, 20-, and 40-layer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of merocyanine (5-[2-(3-octadecyl-2-benzothiazolylidene)ethylidene]-3-carboxy-methyl-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone, referred to as NK 2684; see fig. 3) J-aggregates. The spectra of 20- and 40-layer LB films gave C=C stretching bands due to the central conjugated system at 1556 and 1516 cm-1. These frequencies were lower by 5–9 cm-1 than the corresponding frequencies of NK 2684 J-aggregates in methanolic aqueous solution. This observation suggested that delocalization of π electrons in the central conjugated system becomes more remarkable upon the formation of the LB films. The RR spectrum of mono-layer LB film was somewhat different in the 1600-1500 cm-1 region from those of 20- and 40-layer LB films. This difference may arise from a strong intermolecular interaction between NK 2684 chromophore and the glass substrate."
"Polarized X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been applied to study the local structure and bonding states in Langmuir-Blodgett films of a merocyanine dye diluted with arachidic acid, using synchroton radiation and a fluorescence detection technique. Both in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropies, which decreased after annealing, were observed in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra with respect to the electrical field vector. These results imply that (1) the chromophores are highly oriented with respect to the axis parallel to the dipping direction and plane and (2) these preferential orientations degrade when heat treated. The radial distribution around a chalcogen atom, obtained from the Fourier transform of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure, is interpreted in terms of the intramolecular structure of merocyanine."
"A water-soluble cyanine dye is adsorbed from the solution to form a salt with an arachidic acid monolayer at the air-water interface. Complex monolayers thus formed were deposited onto substrates by the vertical dipping method to form Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films. The optical properties of these films were examined employing a linearly polarized incident light. The films showed a large in-plane anisotropy of light absorption in both visible (electronic transition) and infrared (vibrational transition) regions. The in-plane anisotropy of the LB film is explained as due to the alignment of dimers, each showing Davydov splitting, by flow orientation during dipping. The configuration of the dye molecules in the dimer was estimated using Davydov’s theory and the extended dipole model. The layered structure of the film was determined by the x-ray diffraction technique."
"Interface-adsorbed complex Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of arachidic acid and a water-soluble cyanine dye were fabricated using the diffusion-adsorption method. Formation of an H-aggregate with absorption band split was observed in the LB film. This split is assignable as Davydov splitting, which is characterized as the split of the band into two bands, whose transition moments are orthogonal to each other, due to formation of herringbonelike aggregates. The estimation of the molecular arrangement in the aggregate was performed based on Davydov's theory and the extended dipole model."
"The change in morphology of merocyanine–Cd arachidate mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films induced by hydrothermal treatment (HTT) has been studied using a polarized light photomicroscope and an X-ray diffractometer. By applying HTT of 100% humidity at 70 °C for 60 min, the as-deposited J-band with an in-plane anisotropy is reorganized to an isotropic phase with a sharp peak, and the image, initially anisotropic in brightness, becomes isotropic and filled with round superstructures of 0.1 mm or larger in diameter with an average thickness of presumably less than three monolayers. The change in the X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the Y-type LB lamellar structure remains intact with an enhanced degree of order of the Cd-ion alignment."

"The electronic absorption spectra of pure Langmuir (L) films of 6MeDS prepared upon MgCl2, CaCl2, CdCl2, and CuCl2 aqueous solutions have shown that the Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+ cations promote the J-aggregation of the dye, but the Cu2+ cation inhibits it. Instead, the Cu2+ cation promotes the formation of another type of dye aggregate (D-aggregate), which exhibits a split electronic absorption band. These L films have been transferred onto solid substrates by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. The vibronic absorption spectra observed for the obtained LB films have shown the similarity between the metal–cation-containing J-aggregate and the metal-free J-aggregate of the dye, the latter of which was characterized in the previous study [K. Ikegami, J. Chem. Phys. 121 (2004) 2337]. These spectra have also indicated that the bimolecular metal chelation plays an important role in the J-aggregation, like the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the metal-free case."
"Two novel polysilanes that bear an amphiphilic ammonium moiety in the side substituent are synthesized. The spreading behaviors of these polymers at the air-water interface, the LB deposition, and their spectroscopic properties are investigated. Utilizing the strong UV absorption of the SiSi backbone attributed to the localized σ electron, substantial knowledge on the conformation and orientation of the main chain is readily obtained by UV-visible absorption spectroscopic measurements. Compression of the polysilane monolayer at the air-water interface induces a blue shift of the σ−σ∗ band around 300 nm, which is reasonably attributed to the trans-gauche populatioal changes of the backbone. The SiSi backbone aligns parallel to the dipping direction in the multilayered Langmuir-Blodgett films for both polysilanes."
"When LB films are exposed to the atmosphere vaporized from acid at room temperature, the X-ray diffraction peaks attributed to the lamellar structure disappear and new peaks appear depending on the metal ion species of the salt, whereas such noticeable change is not observed by basic vapor treatment and heat treatment. Diffraction patterns for LB films of free fatty acids are not influenced by these three treatments."
"J-aggregates in Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of mutually mixed merocyanine dyes were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Two merocyanine dyes, one which forms and one which does not form J-aggregates in their LB films with fatty acids and divalent metals, so-called 6MeDS and DO, respectively, were used in this study. In LB films of DO–6MeDS mutual mixtures, most DO molecules are included in J-aggregates. The IR spectra of these films were measured and compared with linear combinations of the spectra for DO and 6MeDS films. The difference between the measured and the calculated IR spectra reflects the difference between the electronic state of J-aggregated DO and that of monomeric DO. The results suggest an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer induced by the formation of J-aggregates."
"The role of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in the characterization of Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films containing functional molecules is discussed. Unpaired electrons in LB films are associated with radical molecules produced by charge transfer, paramagnetic metallic ions such as Cu2+ and so on. ESR parameters such as g-value and hyperfine coupling provide information of local molecular orientation and electronic states. ESR can unambiguously determine the orientation distribution function of molecules through g-value anisotropy. The case of mixed LB films of a merocyanine dye and arachidic acid is discussed as a typical example. The analysis of the anisotropic ESR spectra of stable radicals existing in these films has revealed detailed in-plane orientation of radicals, which led to the discovery of flow orientation effect during LB dipping process. Light-induced ESR (LESR) is introduced to directly detect the dye radicals generated by photoinduced charge transfer. Observed LESR spectra, associated with a resolved 14N hyperfine structure, uniquely probe the orientation and electronic states of dye molecules forming the J-aggregates in highly ordered LB matrix. AFM observation of dye domains in these films is also discussed."
"IR spectra have been measured for cast films of 3-carboxymethyl-5-[2-(3-decylbenzothiazolin-2-ylidene)ethylidene]rhodanine (C10MD) and 3-carboxy-methyl-5-[2-(3-octadecylbenzothiazolin-2-ylidene)ethylidene]rhodanine (C18MD), and cast and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of C18MD treated with BaCl2, CaCl2 and NaCl neutral solutions. The following conclusions can be reached: (1) At room temperature C18MD in the cast films assumes a free form as well as an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded form. However, as the temperature is increased to 120 ° C, the free form is converted into the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded form; further increase in temperature leads to formation of the free form again. (2) Treatment of the cast films of C18MD with the chloride solutions causes the formation of J-aggregates. The hydrocarbon chain is highly ordered and C18MD forms weak intramolecularly hydrogen-bonds via a cation in the J-aggregates. (3) The IR spectra of the LB films of C18MD, on formation of J-aggregates, are similar to those of the cast films treated with the solutions. The electronic structure in the conjugated system undergoes a significant change upon the formation of J-aggregates. (4) The CO group, and thus the chromophore plane, are nearly perpendicular to the substrate surface in both the cast and LB films."
"A Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film, in which proton donors and acceptors were arranged regularly in space, was assembled as a simple model of bacteriorhodopsin. With FT-IR and fluorescence spectroscopic data, it was confirmed that photoinduced intermolecular proton transfer proceeded in the film."
"We used Langmuir–Blodgett films including iron atoms as a catalytic metal material for carbon nanotube (CNT) growth through chemical vapor deposition. We have found a new form of nanotube growth, which we call a giant carbon nanotube construction (GNC). The GNC seems to be a self-assembled knitted structure by carbon nanotubes. The GNC has thin (5 μm in diameter) and long (100 μm in length) structure and is quite different from CNT bundles. The growth mechanism of the GNC was suggested from the SEM images and Raman spectral data. The GNC might have application to CNT sensors, synthetic fiber, and so on."
"We have examined the influence of reduced pressure on the redshifted and the blueshifted aggregates formed in the mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the merocyanine dye–arachidic acid (MS–C20) binary and the MS–C20–n-octadecane (MS-C20-AL18) ternary systems with the molar mixing ratios of [MS]:[C20]:[AL18]=1:2:x in the range of 0≦x≦5.0. The peak of the redshifted band at 590nm in the binary system remains constant before and after the reduced pressure treatments. On the other hand, not only the peaks of the blueshifted bands at 505nm and 520nm but also the redshifted shoulder at around 580nm in the ternary systems drastically diminishes after the treatments, indicating the dissociation of the MS aggregates. The long axis of AL18 molecules with the all-trans conformation, which tends to fill the MS empty spaces, is aligned along the stacking direction of the mixed LB films before the treatments, whereas almost all the AL18 molecules are absent after the treatments. Therefore, the dissociation is considered to be ascribed to the removal of the AL18 molecules with the uniaxial orientation in the mixed LB films by reduced pressure, leading to a change in the MS aggregation state."
"We have studied the mobility and the orientation of the hydrocarbon chain in the Langmuir–Blodgett films of merocyanine dye (MS)–arachidic acid (C20)–n-octadecane (AL18) with the molar mixing ratio [MS]:[C20]:[AL18]=1:2:x (x=0,1,2,3,4,5) by means of infrared spectroscopy. Deuterated C20 (C20-d) and deuterated AL18 (AL18-d) have been used to separate the infrared bands due to the hydrocarbon chain of MS. The bandwidths of CH2 antisymmetric and CH2 symmetric stretching modes decrease in the range from x=0 up to 2, indicating that the motion of the hydrocarbon chain of MS is hindered by mixing the AL18-d molecules as the third component. From x=0 to 2, the orientation of the long axis of the MS hydrocarbon chain is found to change. The change in orientation is associated with the decrease in the mobility of the MS hydrocarbon chain. It is indicated that the J aggregate is accompanied by the thermal motion of the hydrocarbon chain of MS, and that the H aggregate is accompanied by the highly packed state of the hydrocarbon chains of MS and AL18-d, suggesting that the aggregate formation is controlled by the state of hydrocarbon chain packing."
"ESR spectra of the stable radical, associated with nitrogen hyperfine structure, in mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of a merocyanine dye and arachidic acid are dependent on the substrate position. Line-shape analysis yields the local orientation of radical molecules, which exhibits the higher degree of orientation toward the edge of the substrate. This behavior coincides with that of the majority of dye molecules forming J-aggregate, deduced from optical analysis, and is well described by the recent theory of flow orientation during LB dipping process."
"Head-to-tail molecular arrangements of J-aggregates modify not only the excited state, but also the ground state of the dye chromophore therein. To clarify such modification of the ground state, which is related with the aggregation mechanism, infrared absorption spectroscopy has been applied to J-aggregates of two alkylated merocyanine dyes, 6MeDS and DO, formed in their pure or mutually mixed Langmuir–Blodgett films. Some vibrational modes have been found to be softened upon the J-aggregation. The nature of these vibrational modes has been determined by density functional calculations. Then, it has been concluded that the J-aggregation induces an enhancement of intramolecular charge transfer both in the 6MeDS and DO cases, although these two dyes are largely different in their tendency to form J-aggregates."
"Abstract J-Aggregates of a long-chain merocyanine can be formed in the mixed monolayers with glycerol derivatives, phospholipids and cholesterol. Its morphologies observed by a fluorescence microscopy are dependent on the matrix agents and the compositions. The photoactive J-aggregates in LB films were characterized by the weak exciton-phonon coupling and the fluorescence occured by a radiative annihilation from the free exciton state. From measurements of the fluorescence decay curves for a single layer of the J-aggregates, the lifetine has been found to be 5–11 ps irrespective of the matrix agents. In the LB systems containing the J-aggregate as a donor combined with long-chain bipyridinium as an acceptor at a distance of 20.2–30.2 A, it has been found that the fluorescence decays more rapidly."
"The effect of hydrothermal treatments (HTT) on merocyanine (MS)–Cd arachidate mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films has been studied. At temperatures ranging from 30 to 90 °C, the redshifted J-band in the as-deposited state has been found to reorganize under the condition of 100% relative humidity, forming a new phase of further redshifted bands with spectra sharper than those of the as-deposited J-band. The HTT-induced phase closely resembles that induced by the heat treatment without humidity control, while the occurrence of the latter is limited to 60–70 °C. The water content introduced into the LB system during HTT is suggested to play a catalytic role in facilitating the reorganization by its lubricating and/or hydrolyzing effects to soften the film structure."

"Abstract Mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of (10-butyl-9-anthryl)-3-propanoic acid (1) and arachidic acid were prepared and their UV-Vis spectra were measured. Photodimerization of 1 in these LB films was successfully performed with monochromatic light."
"Azobenzene (Az) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films adsorbing cyanine dyes (NK-3) were deposited and the electrical properties were investigated in detail. The current vs electric field characteristics suggested ionic hopping conduction, and the transient current properties showed current peaks due to migration of mobile ions. The thermally stimulated currents (TSCs) were also due to the ionic space charge polarization, that is, displacement of mobile ions over long distances in the LB films. These results indicated that the electrical properties of the Az LB devices are strongly dependent on the mobile ions in the devices. In addition, the TSC and the short-circuit photocurrent properties due to the dyes were also changed by isomerization of the Az molecules. The results showed that the ionic space charge polarization and the aggregates of the dyes were affected by the isomerization."

"The structure of a merocyanine dye (MS) in red- and blue-shifted aggregates involving J- and H-aggregates in mixed LB films of MS–arachidic acid (C20) binary and MS–C20-n-octadecane (AL18) ternary systems ([MS]:[C20]:[AL18] = 1:2:x; x = 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0) fabricated using an aqueous subphase containing Cd2+ ions has been investigated by means of polarized visible and infrared spectroscopy. Not only the AL18 molecules mixed as a third component but also the Cd2+ ions added to distilled water for the subphase used turn out to be the significant elements for the formation of the MS aggregates in all the ternary systems. It has been found that the degree of the MS intramolecular charge transfer strongly depends on the aggregation states; the J-aggregate (x = 0), H-aggregate (x = 1.0), oligomer (x = 2.0) and relatively small aggregates (x = 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0), and that the stabilization by the intramolecular charge transfer for the formation of the MS aggregates is induced according to the individual aggregation states. The gauche conformation is clarified to be slightly involved in the MS hydrocarbon chains for all the binary and ternary systems. The long axis of the MS hydrocarbon chains in the J-aggregates, being fairly tilted from the film normal, gradually approaches to the film normal with the increasing AL18 content up to x = 2.0 with the orientation of the long axis of the MS hydrocarbon chains remaining constant in the subsequent ternary systems. It can be concluded that the formation of the red- and blue-shifted aggregates is ascribed to the difference in the MS slippage which can also be regulated by the degree of the orientation of the MS hydrocarbon chains, and that the decrease in the size of the MS aggregates accompanied by the increasing AL18 content is due to the blocking by the AL18 molecules being out of the empty space on the MS chromophore."

"The occurrence of flow orientation during the deposition of Langmuir-Blodgett films of (TMTTF) 3 (C 14 TCNQ) 2 is shown through studies of in-plane molecular orientation in films deposited by two types of the vertical dipping method, with the substrates parallel and perpendicular to the barrier, using ESR and polarized UV-visible spectroscopies. Larger in-plane anisotropy is observed toward the edge of the substrates, which is consistent with the prediction of the recent theory of flow orientation during the deposition process. Furthermore, in-plane anisotropy in the films deposited by the horizontal lifting method is detected, suggesting the existence of a compression orientation at the air-water interface."
"We have investigated the thermal behavior of J-aggregates in the mixed Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films composed of the merocyanine dye (MS18)-deuterated arachidic acid (C20-d) binary system in the temperature range from 25 to 250 °C by means of UV−visible and IR transmission absorption spectroscopy. The temperature-dependent variations in both UV−visible and IR absorption spectra indicate that the MS18 aggregation states are linked with the MS18 intramolecular charge transfer and the behavior of the packing, orientation, conformation, and thermal mobility of the MS18 hydrocarbon chain. The J-aggregate formed at 25 °C in the mixed LB films dissociates in the temperature range from 25 to 110 °C, which is mainly ascribed to the increase in the thermal mobility of MS18 hydrocarbon chain and the dissociation of the chelation by a cadmium ion to the MS18 keto group. A thermally induced blue-shifted band appears at around 515 nm from 110 to 160 °C. This band is attributed to oligomeric aggregation with side-by-side alignment of the MS18 transition dipole moments on the basis of the shift to a higher-energy side, broadening, and temporary increment of the MS18 intramolecular charge transfer of the band. Consequently, the appearance of the thermally induced blue-shifted band indicates the possibility that the MS18 aggregation states can be controlled from the red shift to the blue shift by the annealing method adopted in the present study."
"Three types of Langmuir-Blodgett film of an azobenzene derivative were prepared by hetero Y-type, Y-type and Z-type deposition methods. The molecular orientations in the films were determined from the analysis of the linear Stark effect (electroabsorption) spectra. Molecules in the hetero Y-type film were proved to align asymmetrically. However, molecular orientation in the Z-type films showed very small asymmetry. Investigation of the long spacings determined from X-ray diffraction supported the conclusion from the Stark effect."
"The molecular orientation and spatial arrangement of all- trans -β-carotene in a spin-coated (SC) film and in a mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film with barium stearate (1:10) were studied by the use of polarized optical absorption and reflection spectroscopies at non-normal incidences. The newly applied analyses of these spectra show that the SC film is an amorphous film with density ρ=0.835 g/cm 3 , refractive index n =1.38 and extinction coefficient κ=1.09 at 445 nm. Based on the axis model proposed by Schmidt and Reich [Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 76 (1972) 1202], the angle of the molecular axis in the LB film relative to the plane of the substrate was determined to be 27°. The relative strengths of the molecular interaction of β-carotene were compared for the n -hexane solution, LB film, SC film, and single crystal. It was shown that the molecules in the LB film are weakly aggregated, although the size of the aggregate is so small that it can be identified as a `monomer'. The Davydov splitting E D of the single crystal is obtained as 170±60 cm -1 ."
"Abstract Aqueous cyanine dyes were adsorbed onto the monolayer of dialkylammonium amphiphiles at the air–water interface. The composite monolayer was successfully transferred on a glass substrate by the conventional Langmuir–Blodgett method, and the adsorbed cyanine dyes were shown to assume J-like aggregation."

"We have studied optical and electrical properties in donor molecule adsorbed TCNQ Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. In fabricating the adsorption LB films, C18TCNQ was used as a spreading material for LB films and TMPD or PPD was used as an adsorbate. The results show that the concentration of donor molecule in aqueous subphase affects the quantity of charge-transfer (CT) complex of the adsorption LB films and the electric conductivity strongly depends on the degree of CT complex formation in the adsorption LB films."
"IR and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) techniques are employed to investigate adsorption Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers deposited on silicon substrate with a thin SiO2 film. Merocyanine dye (MC) and crystal violet (CV) are used as a spreading material and an adsorption dye from an aqueous subphase, respectively. IR and IETS data show that the carboxyl group in the MC molecule and the substituent group in the CV molecule are concerned with the adsorption mechanism."
"The photoelectric conversion of a novel Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film consisting of 3.4.9.10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimides (PTCDI) and amphiphilic zinc phthalocyanine (AmZnPc) were investigated. The results show that the PTCDI molecules were embedded in the cavity between the long alkyl chains of AmZnPc in the monomolecular layer of LB film. The Voc of the monomolecular layer of a mixture of PTCDI (E) and AmZnPc was as high as 145 mV."
"Stable radical species existing in mixed Langmuir-Blodgett films of a merocyanine dye and arachidic acid are studied through their hyperfine couplings using the isotope substitution technique. One of the species shows a nitrogen hyperfine structure possibly arising from one of the two nitrogen sites in the molecule. With the employment of two dye analogs in which either one of the 14N nuclei is replaced by 15N, the observed nitrogen site has been identified to be the one in benzothiazole. That is, the wave function of the radical is directly associated with the dye chromophore. The photo-induced spectra have shown a similar change as the dark spectra upon 15N-substitution, indicating that the dark and photo-induced signals arise from a common species. These facts together with the recently observed correlation between the anisotropic behaviour of ESR and optical J-band strongly suggest an intermolecular charge transfer in J-aggregates as the origin of radical generation."

"A long-chain merocyanine derivative with the chlorine substituent at the 5-position of the benzothiazol moiety has been studied for formation of the stable J-aggregates in the mixed monolayers and their LB films with Cd perfluorooctadecanoate (PFC18) and octadecane (OD) in comparison with the one without the substituent, which forms the H-aggregates in the mixed films with Cd arachidate and OD. In addition to the monolayer π–A isotherms, visible absorption spectra, the grazing angle in-plane X-ray diffraction and the AFM observation indicate that PFC18 promotes J-aggregation of the dye due to the phase separation in the mixed films."

"Formation of the J -aggregates with redshifted bands and the H-aggregates with blue-shifted bands for a long-chain merocyanine (MC) could be controlled by mixing the molecular matrix components in the monolayer assembly. The binary Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film containing MC and Cd arachidate (AA) provided the J -aggregates which have a sharp fluorescence with less Stokes shift. The ternary LB system having MC–AA and octadecane (OD) showed the H-aggregates in addition to the J -aggregates. The structures of the J - and H-aggregates were studied by atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, the photo-induced electron transfer from the MC J -aggregate donor to a long-chain bipyridilium and the energy transfer from another cyanine dye donor to the MC H-aggregate acceptor were investigated in the hetero-LB films by varying the separation between the donor and acceptor layers."
"Pseudoisocyanine (PIC) J-aggregate Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were fabricated and their in-plane anisotropy was examined based on the polarization dependence of optical spectra. The PIC J-aggregate LB films show a large in-plane anisotropy in the J absorption band with the transition moment preferentially oriented perpendicular to the dipping direction of the substrate. Change in spectral shape depending on the polarization direction, which suggests Davydov splitting, was not observed. Interaction between surface plasmons on Ag thin film and the excitons in J aggregates also shows in-plane anisotropy similar to the behavior in absorption spectra."
"The formation and stability of J-aggregates of a [6Me-DS]1−x[DO]x mixed dye system in Langmuir–Blodgett films have been investigated using absorption and photoluminescence measurements. The variations of the spectral weights of the J-aggregate and DO monomer bands with DO content x allowed us to find that there exist two different regions: phase separation and solid solution. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3, J-aggregates are formed from 6Me-DS molecules, and DO molecules exist as a monomer. In the range 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.8, J-aggregates are stably formed from both 6Me-DS and DO molecules. We have also found that the quantum efficiency of the J-aggregate emission for x = 0.6–0.7 is higher than for the pure 6Me-DS dye system."
"A stable radical exists in mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of a merocyanine dye, having benzothiazole as a donor nucleus, and arachidic acid. The wavefunction of the radicals has been studied by using the 14N hyperfine coupling observed in films of pristine dye and the 13C coupling observed in films using a 13C-enriched type. The magnitude and symmetry of 14N and 13C hyperfine tensors, obtained from the spectra, show firstly that the radical wave function extends over the dye-chromophore part and, secondly, that the pπ orbital axes of nitrogen in benzothiazole and the carbon of the central methine chain are nearly parallel. The latter fact excludes the possibility of a spyropiran form as the origin of the radical. These facts show that the generation of the stable radical is a phenomenon associated with the dye molecules in LB films and detail of the wavefunction possibly probes the electronic states of the dye molecules in aggregates."
"By changing the dye concentration with respect to the fatty acid matrix, J-aggregate formation of the 6-methyl-merocyanine dye (6Me-DS) molecules in the mixed Langmuir–Blodgett film is studied by optical absorption and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The J-band is observed in the film with a wide range of molar ratios of the dye to the matrix down to 1:120. The absorption peak shift of approximatelty 80 nm remains almost unchanged with the decrease of the molar ratio. The dye domains are identified by AFM as the region with low height. This is confirmed by comparing the total area of low-height domains with that calculated with the molecular occupation area ratio on the water surface. Typical dye domains with more than 103 molecules are observed, even in the films of 1:120 molar ratio. The size is consistent with the expected size of J-aggregates calculated with the extended dipole model using the observed wavelength shift."
"Monolayers of the triblock copolymers consisting of poly(γ-benzyl l-glutamate) (PBLG) as the hydrophobic group and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the hydrophilic one could be formed on the air-water interface. Monolayer behavior of PBLG/PEO/PBLG block copolymer is affected on the content of PEO in the block copolymer. Circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared data showed that the block copolymer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were formed as an oriented state of the polymer chains by the compression, and the in-plane orientation is also dependent on the content of PEO in the block copolymer. Atomic force microscopy showed that the packing of the PBLG LB film was found to be ordered."

"Abstract Mixed monolayers with merocyanine dye and arachidic acid were investigated by the atomic force microscope and the second harmonic generation microscope. From the observations, we found that the miscibility of these two molecules, the cluster size of merocyanine J-aggregates and the second harmonic images were strongly influenced by the ionic compound in subphase."
"The effect of heat treatment at 60–70°C has been studied for merocyanine (MS)–Cd arachidate mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films. MS chromophores are found to be reorganized by the heat treatments to form a novel phase of a redshifted band with spectra sharper than those of the J-band in the as-deposited films. The reorganization of MS seems to be closely related with the mobility of alkyl chains in the LB system, suggesting that the mild heat treatments will introduce another possible method of modifying the properties of films."
"We have studied the red-shifted and the blue-shifted bands in the mixed Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the merocyanine dye (MS)–arachidic acid (C20)–n-octadecane (AL18) ternary systems with the molar mixing ratio [MS]:[C20]:[AL18]=1:2:x (0.5≤x≤1.5). The overlapping spectra of the red-shifted and the blue-shifted bands are typically seen in the ternary systems and they are deconvoluted into the J- and H-bands. We compare the aggregation number N and the other structural parameters of the J- and H-aggregates estimated using the point dipole model and the extended dipole model referring to the deconvoluted spectra. For the J-aggregate of MS, the minimum aggregation number is estimated to be Nmin=40 in both models. The slip angle between the long axis of the aggregate and the MS transition dipole moment is estimated as α=40° and α=30° for the point dipole model and the extended dipole model, respectively. The latter α-value is in good agreement with those in the earlier works, while the former α-value is appreciably larger than the earlier estimates, reconfirming the validity of the extended dipole model. The α-value is estimated to be 50° for the H-aggregate, assuming the same Nmin-value based on the results of the extended dipole model."
"Fluorescence emission was collected from cyanine-dye-impregnated Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of cadmium arachidate deposited on the surface of a quartz multimode optical fiber. A Y-type fiber optic coupler system was used to allow remote, distal-end spectral excitation and collection as the fiber tip was repeatedly dipped into the LB trough. Built-up LB films of up to 400 LB layers were examined. Fluorescence emission intensities were modeled as a function of the number of layers, or LB film thickness, using a simplified theory based on planar thin film optics. The fit of theory to experiment was qualitatively satisfying, indicating that LB films of reasonable optical quality can be deposited on the surface of cylindrical optical fibers."
"The in-plane anisotropy of the Langmuir–Blodgett films of a merocyanine-fatty acid mixed system has been further studied for two different cases of batch production with the substrates aligned face to face and side by side, respectively, to clarify the limitations of the flow-orientation model based on the ideal-fluid approximation. For the side-by-side case, satisfactory coincidence is found between the model and experiment. The actual dichroic behavior deviates from that predicted for the face-to-face case with smaller intersubstrate distances. It was speculated that the stagnation point is associated with anomaly in velocity which is responsible for this discrepancy. In order to examine this, the flow of the monolayer on the water surface during the deposition has been observed using sulphur powder as marker in addition to the optical measurements. The actual flow deviates from that expected from the model and is associated with unsteady motion around the stagnation point as previously speculated. It is indicated that the ideal-fluid approximation is inappropriate for the face-to-face case with smaller distances, leading to the prediction inconsistent with the actual dichroic behavior."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of crystal violet (CV) dyes incorporating cyanine (Cy) dyes (CVCy LB films) have been prepared by the diffusion–adsorption LB method, and the optical properties have been investigated. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the CVCy LB films, a weak, narrow peak at around 470 nm and an intense peak at around 700 nm were observed, which were caused by the Cy and the CV dyes, respectively. The PL peak at about 470 nm became more intense as the irradiation time of the laser excitation light increased. The PL peak initially appearing at about 700 nm, broadened and moved to lower wavelength with increasing irradiation time. CV/DSACy LB heterofilm of the CV LB film without Cy dyes on distearyldimethylammonium bromide (DSA) LB film with adsorbed Cy dyes (DSACy LB film) was also prepared for the comparison. The absorption spectrum was similar to that of the CVCy LB film. On the contrary, in the PL spectrum of the CV/DSACy LB hetrofilm, the peak at around 470 nm was more intense and the peak at around 700 nm was weaker. From the results, the PL properties of the CVCy LB films were thought to be related to the energy transfer between the CV and the Cy dyes."
"Several triphenyl methane derivatives (TPMs) having different substituents can be adsorbed from an aqueous solution to Langmuir films consisting of arachidic acid (AR) or a mixture of AR and merocyanine dye (MC). The substituent dependence of the adsorption phenomenon shows that the adsorption mechanisms of TPM to AR and MC are mainly due to charge-charge and dipole-dipole interactions, respectively. Moreover, a peculiar property such as a negative photoelectric effect was obtained in the dye-adsorbed Langmuir-Blodgett films."
"In-plane anisotropy of Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films is affected by the arrangement of substrates when many samples are batch produced in one single trough. We examined the dichroic behavior for two different cases of the batch production. In the case of substrates aligned side by side, the dichroic behavior is similar to that in the single-substrate production and agrees with the flow orientation model. In the face-to-face case, however, the tendency is quite different from both the single-substrate production and the side-by-side case, clearly deviating from the theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is suggested to be due to a dead water area which should be formed around the stagnation point."

"We have characterized the structure of J-aggregate in a Langmuir-Blodgett film of pure merocyanine dye (MS18) fabricated under an aqueous subphase containing a cadmium ion (Cd2+) and have investigated its thermal behavior by UV-visible and IR absorption spectroscopy in the range from 25 to 250 degrees C with a continuous scan. The results of both UV-visible and IR absorption spectra indicate that temperature-dependent changes in the MS18 aggregation state in the pure MS18 system are closely and mildly linked with the MS18 intramolecular charge transfer and the behavior of the packing, orientation, conformation, and thermal mobility of MS18 hydrocarbon chain, respectively. The J-aggregate in the pure MS18 system dissociates from 25 to 150 degrees C, and the dissociation temperature at 150 degrees C is higher by 50 degrees C than that in the previous MS18- arachidic acid (C20) binary system. The lower dissociation temperature in the binary system originates from the fact that temperature-dependent structural disorder of cadmium arachidate (CdC20), being phase-separated from MS18, has an influence on the dissociation of J-aggregate. From 160 to 180 degrees C, thermally induced blue-shifted bands, caused by the oligomeric MS18 aggregation, appear at around 520 nm in the pure MS18 system by contraries, regardless of the lack of driving force by the melting phenomenon of CdC20. The temperature at which the 520 nm bands occur is in good agreement with the melting point (160 degrees C) of hydrocarbon chain in MS18 with Cd2+, whereas its chromophore part is clearly observed to melt near 205 degrees C by UV-visible spectra. Therefore, it is suggested that the driving force that induces the 520 nm band in the pure MS18 system arises from the partial melting of hydrocarbon chain in MS18 with Cd2+."
"Langmuir (L) film and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of a merocyanine dyes (MC) containing C18 alkyl chain mixed with arachidic acid (AA) and n-octadecane (OD) were fabricated. Surface-pressure–area isotherms of an L film and absorption spectra of LB films deposited on a substrate were measured. Amphiphilic molecular orientation in the L film and the built-up proportion of MC J-aggregates to monomer and H-aggregates in MC-LB films mixed with AA and OD were controlled by altering the molar ratio of AA and OD to MC. The built-up proportion of MC J-aggregates in LB films decreased and the J-aggregates decayed to monomer and H-aggregates by increasing the exposure power of a 608-nm monochromatic light."
"Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of mixtures of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), merocyanine dye (DO) and arachidic acid (C20) with different molecular ratios, were prepared on Cd2+-containing and pure-water subphases. The characterization of mixed Langmuir and LB films were performed by using, respectively, surface pressure–molecular area isothermetry and UV–Vis–IR absorption spectroscopy. The analysis indicates that interaction between the two dyes modifies their arrangements and electronic states in their mixed Langmuir films spread upon the Cd2+-containing subphase. However, the mixed LB films with the pure-water subphase are showed to be simple physical mixtures. The difference in the mixing effect observed for the Langmuir films upon the Cd-containing and pure-water subphases may be caused by the formation of metal chelation with the former subphase."
"Electroabsorption spectra were measured for Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films which contain a merocyanine J -aggregate monolayer. The LB films, which possess asymmetrical molecular arrangement, were employed to investigate linear electrochromism. A clear difference was observed in the spectra between linear and quadratic electrochromism."

"We developed a transient photoinduced voltage measuring system and then investigated the photoinduced electron transfer in heterostructured polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett films consisting of a polyimide of one type (PI) and a polyimide of another type containing a tetraphenylporphyrin moiety (PORPI). The photoinduced transient voltage depended on the PORPI layers (n), indicating that there are two kinds of electron transfer mechanism. For n exceeding 3, the maximum value of the induced transient voltage increases with n. We conclude that photoexcited electrons were transported in PORPI films at a distance of 2–4 nm."

"The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of mixed LB films of a conjugated dimer-type Cu-porphyrin and cadmium arachidate show a drastic change by adding a small amount of n-hexatriacontane as trigger molecules that cause a distinct change of orientation of porphyrins. Similar phenomenon has been observed in monomer-type Cu-porphyrin LB films. The marked difference between these cases is that the dimer films show a septet Cu hyperfine structure instead of a quartet of the monomer films with the total spectral span unchanged. This results from the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction between two Cu spins in a dimer, providing direct evidence for the existence of the dimer in LB films. The line-shape analysis of the ESR spectra observed at the X and K bands yields the detailed molecular orientation. The dimer plane is slightly more inclined toward the film plane compared with monomers in the presence of n-hexatriacontane."
"The Förster energy transfer between chromophores in several different types of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films exposed to aqueous conditions was examined. The donor and acceptor chromophores were either contained in a monolayer of a preformed copolymer incorporating amphiphilic side chains and hydrophilic spacer groups (dansyldihexadecylamine as the donor and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate as the acceptor) or grafted to a monolayer of such a copolymer (anthracene as the donor and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole as the acceptor). The monolayers containing donor or acceptor chromophores were separated by neutral spacer layers of cadmium arachidate or copolymer material. It was found that the unattached chromophores diffused through the LB films during the experimental procedure and for several days afterwards. LB films containing chromophores that were grafted to copolymer and copolymer material spacer layers possessed high translayer structural order. There was evidence, however, that indicated that the structure relaxed with time."
"The technology of the formation of LB films has much in common with the trough technology discussed in Chapter 3. In addition to the equipment described there, one needs a mechanical device to raise and lower the substrate through the air/water interface at a predetermined rate. Various devices have been employed but it is usual to provide the vertical movement by driving a large micrometer screw by an electric motor via a reduction gear train. Practical velocities are such that they are usually measured in millimetres per minute. It is essential to be able to vary the dipping rate as there is an upper effective rate which can be employed for any particular material. This rate is determined by the speed at which water drains from the film as it is withdrawn from the subphase and by the viscosity of the film and hence the rate at which material can approach the substrate. For a material of high viscosity this procedure is difficult to carry out properly and a substantial difference in pressure may occur between the pressure sensor and the region immediately in contact with the substrate. In fully automated troughs the substrate is withdrawn from the subphase and maintained in this position while the film at the air/water interface is respread and compressed to a predetermined dipping pressure. In such systems it is necessary to carry through a cyclic compression and expansion process several times to arrive at a good approximation to an equilibrium situation before the dipping process is reactivated."
"Easily oxidizable components simply arranged and/or highly oriented in a monolayer on an aqueous subphase as well as in a Langmuir–Blodgett film were found to be chemically stabilized by the addition of biological water-soluble antioxidants such as glutathione, uric acid, and ascorbic acid."
"The monolayer of the mixture of octadecanoic acid and octadecylamine with molar ratio 1:1 has been investigated at the air–water interface. It was found that the monolayer shows a rather stable state at the surface pressure of 30 mN/m and this monolayer can be transferred onto a CaF2 plate by Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. The infrared spectra of LB films indicated that octadecylammonium octadecanoate is formed by an intermolecular proton exchange between adjacent carboxylic and aminic groups (COO− and NH3+). In three-layer LB film, the CH2 scissoring mode of the long hydrocarbon chains of octadecylammonium octadecanoate shows a broad band feature at about 1468 cm−1 while this vibrational mode of three-layer LB film of the mixture (1:1) of deuterated stearic acid and octadecylamine (octadecylammonium octadecanoate-d35, C18H37NH3+C17D35COO−) only shows a narrow band. The broad feature of the CH2 scissoring mode in octadecylammonium octadecanoate probably originates from the coupling between the chain of stearic acid and that of octadecylamine while this kind of coupling could be completely removed in octadecylammonium octadecanoate-d35. Another conclusion presented in this paper is that there are no couplings among the chains of fatty acid or among the chains of octadecylamine in LB films of octadecylammonium octadecanoate."
"We have investigated the effects of molecular organization in mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of 11-(9-carbazolyl)undecanoic acid (CUA) and palmitic acid on the fluorescence characteristics of these films. The fluorescence from carbazolyl chromophores was quenched rapidly at the initial stage of irradiation of the LB films in air or in argon while little or no changes in the absorption spectra were observed. No fluorescence quenching was observed for CUA in irradiated solutions or in LB films stored in the dark. The extent of the fluorescence quenching depended on the temperature, atmosphere type, irradiation time, and the mole fraction of CUA in the mixed LB films. Such amplified fluorescence quenching was attributed to efficient energy transfer by exciton hopping among carbazolyl chromophores inhomogeneously aggregated and distributed in the LB films to a trace amount of non-radiative sites formed by photooxidation or changes in the molecular interaction of the carbazolyl chromophores."
"The long-range charge transfer correlated with the existence of fractal nanostructure for thin Fe-containing Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of thiophene derivatives has been experimentally observed. Band structure of the film with hexagon crystal structure has been simulated assuming 26 carbon atoms and one(or two) Fe atom in cluster in elementar cell and validity of adiabatic approximation. The simulations display, that the energy of the structure is reduced when taking into account the ferromagnetic ordering. This leads to the stabilization of the structure. Dynamically invertible instability of band structure at changes of spin polarization is considered as appearance of photo-induced quasi-steady states of nanostructured LB-films. Temperature Green function method has been proposed to examine relativistic corrections for Fermi system which are caused by non-sphericity of atom potential in leaky packed solids. The origin of quasi-stationary modes in Dirac problem is considered for an electron in the vicinity of the ionization threshold in a strong oscillating magnetic field."
"Abstract Thermogravimetry analysis of polyallylamine modified by perfluoroacylation showed that thermal cross linking occurred if less than 20% of the amino groups in polyallylamine were modified by perfluoroacylation. The Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) Z type films of these low modified polymers were prepared and cross linked LB films were successfully prepared by heating these films. Characterization of the cross linked LB films was attempted."
"Polyoxometalates (POMs) have remarkable properties and a great deal of potential to meet contemporary societal demands regarding health, environment, energy and information technologies. However, implementation of POMs in various functional architectures, devices or materials requires a processing step. Most developments have considered the exchange of POM counterions in an electrostatically driven approach: immobilization of POMs on electrodes and other surfaces including oxides, embedding in polymers, incorporation into Layer-by-Layer assemblies or Langmuir-Blodgett films and hierarchical self-assembly of surfactant-encapsulated POMs have thus been thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the field of organic-inorganic POM hybrids has expanded and offers the opportunity to explore the covalent approach for the organization or immobilization of POMs. In this critical review, we focus on the use of POM hybrids in selected fields of applications such as catalysis, energy conversion and molecular nanosciences and we endeavor to discuss the impact of the covalent approach compared to the electrostatic one. The synthesis of organic-inorganic POM hybrids starting from bare POMs, that is the direct functionalization of POMs, is well documented and reliable and efficient synthetic procedures are available. However, as the complexity of the targeted functional system increases a multi-step strategy relying on the post-functionalization of preformed hybrid POM platforms could prove more appealing. In the second part of this review, we thus survey the synthetic methodologies of post-functionalization of POMs and critically discuss the opportunities it offers compared to direct functionalization."

"Abstract The monolayer stability of polyamic acid salts (PAAS) increases as the chain length of salts increases and the hysteresis of the π-A isotherms is found when compressed and expanded. The transferabilities of the monolayers were sharply influenced by the stability at the interface, but not affected by the dipping conditions. In a well-balanced condition, the Langmuir film is transferred as a Y-type on various substrates. The thickness of PAAS was found to be 16.7 Å. After imidization, it was reduced to 5.6 Å per layer, but some ordered structures sustained."

"The electrical and optical properties of polydiacetylene (10, 12-pentacosa-diynoic acid) films deposited by using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and then polymerized were studied. A change in electrical conduction with polymerization suggested the contribution of the conjugated system as hopping centers. Third harmonic generation was observed, and a change in third order susceptibility chi /sup (3)/ is discussed in connection with structural change associated with polymerization, annealing, and so on. The third-harmonic generation is mainly due to the blue form and the structure responsible for the optical absorption around 700 nm did not contribute much to the third-harmonic generation. Steric constraints due to this structure may suppress the polymerization and extension of a conjugate system. Deposition of multilayers seems to increase structural defects and hinder the progress of polymerization. The conjugated system due to polymerization may act as additional hopping centers.< <ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">&gt;</ETX>"
"Abstract Self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) of HS‐(CH 2 ) 2 ‐X with X being ‐COOH, ‐OH, ‐NH 2 , and ‐CH 2 SO 3 Na were fabricated on Au surfaces for deposition of C 8 H 17 ‐C 6 H 4 ‐N=N‐C 6 H 4 O‐(CH 2 ) 3 ‐COOH(ABD) LB films. Thus‐created SAM/LB interfaces were studied by the grazing‐angle incident reflection absorption FTIR technique. For ‐NH 2 group, the interface was proved to be dominated by ‐NH 3 +‐ OOC‐ ionic bonding structure. When X was ‐COOH, an eight‐membered face‐to‐face hydrogen bond was observed at the SAM/LB interface. With the ‐OH terminated interface, two types of hydrogen bond were created: one is the face‐to‐face hydrogen bond and the other one is the side‐by‐side hydrogen bond. In the case of Au/‐CH 2 SO 3 Na/HOOC‐ interface, two terminal groups seem to exchange their cations, forming a ‐CH 2 SO 3 H/NaOOC‐structure. The stability of these monolayer assemblies was investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). It is found that all these films showed a greatly improved structural stability and the destructive three‐dimensional rearrangement of ABD molecules has been effectively prohibited. The sequence of film stability was ‐NH 2 &gt;‐COOH&gt;‐OH&gt;‐CH 2 SO 3 Na, with the first two interfaces exhibiting even nice stability in aqueous solution, strong enough for tolerating the interfacial electron transfer studies."

Their Langmuir-Blodgett film-forming properties, UV-Vis spectra and the second-order nonlinearity of LB films have been investigated. The introduction of the dysprosium complexes into the hemicyanine systems obviously improved film-forming properties and enhanced the second-order nonlinearity."
"We have prepared Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer and multilayer films of a polymeric amphiphile with a side chain containing a chromophore of high molecular hyperpolarizability for second order nonlinear optics. Using optical techniques including polarized transmission and attenuated total reflectance spectroscopies, second harmonic generation, and ellipsometry, we have characterized the orientational order of the chromophore and other polymer groups in the films. The high degree of chromophoric order seen in these films indicates that such polymers are good candidates as materials to fabricate Langmuir-Blodgett films for nonlinear optical applications."

By means of polarization techniques and with the application of the uniaxial and biaxial orientation models, the orientation characteristics of the long hydrocarbon chains and the = C-O linkage in the LB films have been investigated, giving rise to the detailed information of the arrangement of molecular fragments in the 1-SDS composite LB films."

We present the first images of a bilayer containing the protein concanavalin A. These experiments confirm the possibility of obtaining STM images by electron transport through layers of organic molecules more than 50 Å thick. Sample preparation, microscopic technique, and results are discussed."
"A polystyrene−poly(ethylene oxide) containing diblock copolymer, when spread at the air/water interface, spontaneously forms surface aggregates. This surface aggregation is shown to be neither compression-induced, associated with micellization in the spreading solvent, nor induced by the Langmuir−Blodgett film transfer process. We have previously found that such two-dimensional surface aggregation occurs for diblock copolymers with a polystyrene block and a hydrophilic block of quaternized poly(vinylpyridine), poly(tert-butyl acrylate), poly(n-butyl acrylate), or poly(dimethylsiloxane). The phenomenon has also been observed in films of polystyrene−poly(methyl methacrylate) by Rice and co-workers.1 Indeed, whenever an appropriate imaging technique has been used, phase-separated domains with 30−100 nm length scales have been observed, when amphiphilic diblock copolymers are spread at the air/water interface and transferred to solid substrates at appreciable surface pressures. We therefore believe that the formation of surface aggregates (often well defined) is a general phenomenon for hydrophobic−hydrophilic diblock copolymers. The implications of this phenomenon for the study of diblock copolymers at the air/water interface are discussed, particularly in relation to studies using techniques which report properties averaged over the lateral dimensions of the film in question, such as specular neutron reflectivity, specular X-ray reflectivity, and Brewster angle microscopy."

"Stilbazolium dimers were designed and synthesized in which methylene groups of different lengths link the two chromophores. The second-order nonlinear optical property has been detected from their Langmuir−Blodgett monolayers. Photocurrent generation as well as other photophysical properties such as absorption and fluorescence were investigated. Comparing the dimers with the stilbazolium monomer, we found strong second harmonic generation (SHG) signals and remarkable enhanced photoelectric conversion (PEC) quantum yields from 1,3-Bis [(E)- 4-(2-(4-(N-methyl, N-octadecylamino) phenyl) ethenyl) pyridinyl]-alkane dibromide (B3) and 1,5-Bis [(E)- 4-(2-(4-(N-methyl, N-octadecylamino) phenyl) ethenyl) pyridinyl]-alkane dibromide (B5). The structures of the Langmuir−Blodgett films of these dyes are assumed. Although these dimers are center-symmetric (or quasi-center-symmetric) molecules, they can form the ordered non-center-symmetric (in normal direction) monolayer by the compress force and the molecular interaction between the amphiphilic dye molecules and the water molecules at the air/water interface. The influences of bias, donor/acceptor, soluble oxygen, and light intensity to photocurrent generation were studied; our results provide a new perspective to improve the performance of functional molecular material without any change of the chemical structure of the chromophore itself."
"A carboxymethyl pullulan with 1.4 carboxymethyl functions per anhydroglucose unit has been esterified with bromododecane. The number of dodecyl chains per anydroglucose unit calculated from elemental analysis is 1.15 ± 0.09. The partially esterified carboxymethyl pullulan is able to form Langmuir films. Pressure−area isotherms are reproducible, and the film is characterized by a very high stability. IR spectroscopy analysis of Langmuir−Blodgett films prepared on subphases with various pH confirms that the esterification was not complete. Scanning force microscopy images of a monolayer transferred onto muscovite show the great homogeneity of the monolayer. While the monolayer transferred on muscovite is fragile, multilayers transferred on CaF2 slides are resistant to mechanical and chemical treatments."
"Abstract The absolute molecular orientation of tolan derivative 4-docosylamino-4′-nitorotolan (DCANT) Langmuir-Blodgett films transferred by a horizontal lifting method was determined by the phase measurement of second-harmonic generation (SHG). The absorption spectra of the multilayers indicated DCANT molecules aligned in an in-plane anisotropy. In the phase measurement of SHG, the absolute molecular orientation of the DCANT multilayer was determined in comparison with the interference pattern of a poled polymethylmethacrylate film doped with p-nitroaniline, whose absolute molecular orientation was known. The results indicated the DCANT molecules aligned in parallel each other and the absolute molecular orientation was perpendicular to the direction of compression at the air/water interface, which was probably achieved during the compression process in a long and narrow trough."
"In contrast to the majority of all known cell types, Gram-negative bacteria have a second membrane, the outer membrane, which is an asymmetric bilayer composed of a phospholipid inner leaflet and a glycolipid outer leaflet. The glycolipid layer, in most cases being composed of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is the first target for antimicrobial agents. To get a basic understanding of the membrane-forming properties of LPS, we reconstituted monolayers of deep rough mutant LPS from Salmonella enterica serova Minnesota (R595 LPS), its lipid A moiety, and of the synthetic tetraacyl compound 406 (resembling the biosynthetic lipid A precursor IVa) at the air-water interface of a film balance. The liquid-expanded (LE) and liquid-condensed (LC) domains in the coexisting region were investigated with epifluorescence and, after transferring the monolayer onto mica, as a Langmuir-Blodgett film, with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The fluorescence and the AFM images showed identical domain structure. The higher resolution of the AFM images, however, contained more topographic details. Different heights and adhesion forces between the LE and LC domains could be observed. Differences in the adhesion forces between the AFM tip and the sample were determined in the repulsive and the attractive dynamic scanning modes, demonstrating the importance of a careful interpretation of height images. We propose that an increase in the lateral pressure causing the LE-LC transition of the monolayers leads to a reorientation of the molecules due to a tilt angle between the alkyl chains and the diglucosamine backbone. LPS monolayers have been utilized as a simplified reconstitution model of the outer membrane to study the interaction with antimicrobial agents. We investigated the action of the polycationic peptide polymyxin B (PMB) and found dramatic influences on the domain structures."

"A regioregular polythiophene bearing an optically active substituent at the 3-position of thiophene ring, Head-to-Tail poly(3-[2-((S)-1-methyloctyloxy)ethyl]thiophene) (HT-P(S)MOET), was synthesized using highly reactive zinc. HT-P(S)MOET had more than 95% Head-to-Tail coupling with a Mw of 3.72 × 104 (Mw/Mn = 1.20) as estimated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. HT-P(S)MOET had strong negative Cotton effect at about 560 and 610 nm and positive Cotton effect at about 490 nm. The presence of circular dichroism effect shows that the chirality of side chains induces the optical activity in poly(thiophene) main chains. The Langmuir-Blodgett films of HT-P(S)MOET exhibited well-defined layer structure and unique optical properties."
"An amphiphilic analogue of barbituric acid, 5-n-docosylbarbituric acid, has been synthesised and used for the fabrication of alternate-layer Langmuir-Blodgett structures with 1-docosylamine and 22-tricosenoic acid. The films exhibited pyroelectric coefficients of 0.35 mu Cm/sup -2/ K/sup -1/ and 0.5 mu Cm/sup -2/ K/sup -1/ respectively. We suggest that these values may represent the pyroelectric activity associated with the amine and acid headgroups."
"The thermally induced structural changes in Langmuir–Blodgett films of Ca-arachidate with one and nine layer thicknesses and those in self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols were investigated systematically between 300 and 410 K using near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. With increasing temperature the initial strong linear NEXAFS dichroism reflecting the high degree of orientational order within the films decreases continuously and vanishes above 390 K. In addition, the spectra recorded for elevated temperatures (above 400 K) show a peak splitting of the prominent R* resonance at 287.7 eV which is attributed to changes in the electronic structure of the alkane chains caused by thermally induced structural defects, i.e., gauche conformations. The intensity of this new feature increases exponentially with temperature and allows one to extract an energy of 46 kJ/mol (480 meV) for the creation of a gauche conformation in densely packed hydrocarbon films."

"Effective, nonspecific interactions of lipid monolayers of octadecanoic acid, methyl octadecanoate, and octadecanol with aqueous neutral polymers of poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene glycol) were investigated. These polymers dissolved in the subphase expanded surface monolayers at low surface pressures effectively (even at 10-6 unit M ), but did not disturb the molecular packing in their condensed phases. Fluorescence microscopic observations indicated that the aqueous polymers decreased the domain size of the monolayers and induced crystal growth on compression. Resistance of monolayers to collapse, as examined by monitoring area changes at constant pressures, showed that the polymers stabilized monolayers by suppressing the collapse process. However, the polymers did not accompany the monolayer in the Langmuir-Blodgett transfer onto solid surfaces. The absence of the polymer in the transferred film was confirmed by the quartz crystal microbalance technique, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Small concentrations of neutral polymers in the aqueous subphase facilitated transfer of neat lipid monolayers to homogeneous Langmuir-Blodgett films."
"As a method for characterizing the electronic state and molecular orientation of organic materials put on electrodes, infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IR-RAS) is a well-known powerful tool. We have demonstrated that transparent electrodes based on zinc oxide are useful as substrates for the IR-RAS measurements. Although their absorption-signal enhancement effect is smaller than that of gold substrates, sometimes IR-RAS with them provides a better basis than that with gold for discussing the molecular orientation."

"Unlike usual monopolar double chain-amphiphiles, bipolar 1,1′-dotriacontamethylenebis(2-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bends into a U-form at an air-water interface, giving a Langmuir monolayer displaying a peculiar surface pressure-surface area isotherm."
"A new method is described for the preparation of conducting Langmuir-Blodgett films based on tetrathialfulvalene (TTF) derivatives without long alkyl chain substitution. The mixed molecular system of behenic acid (BA) and oxygen-substituted TTF-type donor molecules such as 4,5-ethylenedioxy-4′,5′-ethylenedithio-tetrathiafulvalene (EOET) or bis-ethylenedioxy-tetrathiafulvalene (BO) provides a stable bilayer film at the air/water interface. In the LB films prepared by Y-type deposition, the donor molecules form mixed-valence dimers such as D+ D0, without secondary treatments. The maximum conductivities of the LB films reached 1.0S cm−1 (EOET + BA) and 25 S cm−1 (BO + BA) at room temperature. The surface pressure/area isotherms and Fourier transform infra-red spectra are also reported with regard to, respectively, film formation on the water surface and the mixed-valence dimer state under different molar ratios of the donors to B A."
"An emerging concept, nanoarchitectonics, is supposed to work on the preparation of functional materials systems from nanoscale components. Because porphyrin derivatives show their importance in many research targets, discussions on nanoarchitectonics with porphyrins and related molecules would provide meaningful opportunities to consider effective usages of the nanoarchitectonics. This review article explains various examples of nanoarchitectonics approaches with porphyrin derivatives. The examples are especially focused on two topics: (i) materials nanoarchitectonics for nanofibers, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks; (ii) interfacial nanoarchitectonics for surface monolayers (self-assembled monolayers), Langmuir-Blodgett films, and layer-by-layer assemblies. Functions and properties can be enhanced upon their organization in specific dimensions and arrangements in nanostructured frameworks. In many cases, interface-specific organization would lead to advanced performances with high efficiency and specificity. Even though only limited examples are described here, various possibilities are actually suggested. Not limited to porphyrin families, nanoarchitectonics for functional materials has to be considered with a wide range of materials."
"Abstract The electrical properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films containing ethyl β-apo-8′-carotenoate are reported. The incorporation of this derivative of carotene into fatty acid multilayers was found to increase substantially the electrical conductivity measured perpendicular to the substrate plane. An increase in the in-plane conductivity could also be achieved by exposure of the multilayer assembly to iodine vapour."
"Chemosensory devices with self organized structures and artificial receptors are developed for a wide field of applications. Supramolecular hosts, highly ordered liquid crystal phases and even Langmuir Blodgett films are promising recognition elements. Cage compounds such as tert- butyl-calix[n]arene show high preorganization due to their rigid walls and form highly symmetrical cavities suitable for host guest inclusion of analytes. Disturbance of the highly ordered cholesteric and nematic phases influences the optical and dielectric properties of these materials."
"The monolayer-forming capabilities of a tertiary amine-capped dialkyloxy biphenyl mesogen at the air-water interface were studied. It was found that stable monolayers are obtained in the presence of a water-soluble polymer in the subphase, notably the sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose. Furthermore, the formation of a surface-adsorbed polymer layer, either by aspiration of the depletion layer or by heating, prior to the spreading of the mesogen resulted in higher surface pressures. The stable monolayers were successfully transferred to glass and aluminium substrates to give multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett films. Reflection Infrared Spectra of the transferred films were obtained, and they indicated that both components are indeed present and that the biphenyl moiety and alkyl spacer of the mesogen both have a net orientation perpendicular to the film surface."
"In theoretical study, a distinction is made between the direct and the resonant collisions which govern electron energy loss spectroscopy of vibrational excitations in molecular media. Direct scattering takes place via long-range Coulomb and short-range vibronic interactions; the corresponding cross sections depend upon the reduced mass of the vibrational mode as M−12. On the other hand, the resonant collisions, involving the formation of a transient negative ion, have cross sections that scale as M14. Notable isotope effects have been found for the CH and CD stretching vibrations in organic compounds and were investigated by considering the high resolution electron energy loss spectra obtained with Langmuir-Blodgett films of mixtures of hydrogenated and deuterated stearic acid. From the ratio of the excitation cross sections for the CD and CH stretching vibrations, measured as a function of incident electron energies up to 10 eV, the relative importance of the direct and resonance scattering processes was estimated. For incident energies below a critical value between 4 and 5 eV, only direct scattering is operative; at the critical value, a resonance mechanism sets in, which rapidly contributes at the higher energies, at least equally with the direct collisions. Arguments are given indicating that the lowest-energy resonance has the lowest σ∗ (HCH) configuration."
"Using optical second-harmonic (SH) generation and polarized absorption (PA) measurements, the orientational ordering process of 4-pentyl-4′-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) was studied during evaporation onto the alignment layer of polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett films. The intensity of SH signal increased in the beginning of the deposition, but it saturated after the first 5CB monolayer was formed. The PA measurement suggested that a layer-by-layer growth was induced after the formation of 5CB monolayer with accompanying the orientational ordering. The orientational order of the first 5CB monolayer was studied in terms of the orientational order parameters, S1 = 〈cosθ〉 and S2 = 〈(3cos2θ − 1)/2〉, using the SHG and PA measurements. It was found that S1 decreased as the thickness of PI alignment layer increased from 0.4 to 4.4 nm, while S2 was nearly constant. These results indicate that the Coulomb interaction between the permanent dipole of 5CB and its image dipole makes a significant contribution to the orientational ordering of deposited 5CBs."
"Deposition of Langmuir-blodgett films and the aggregative properties of two asymmetric substituted naphthalocyanine derivatives were investigated by using linear absorption spectra and surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherm lines. The LB films could be formed very well for both compounds. Both compounds could form H-aggregation in the solutions and LB films. The monomers are the main formation in the solutions for both compounds, and the H-aggregates are the main formation in LB films. The molecules of the compounds are leant on subphase surface. But the declining angle of tri-tert-butyl-cyan naphthalocyanine molecules is smaller than that of tri-tert-butyl naphthalocyanine due to cyano-group interaction."
