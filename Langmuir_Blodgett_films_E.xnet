"The amphiphilic C60-dendrimer conjugates 1 and 2 with one and two glycodendron headgroups, respectively, form stable, ordered monomolecular Langmuir layers at the air−water interface. The bulky glycodendron headgroups in 1 and 2 are very effective in suppressing fullerene aggregation, resulting in reversible compression and expansion behavior. The absence of fullerene aggregation was also revealed by the UV−vis spectra of the Langmuir monolayers and by Brewster angle microscopy. The monolayers of 1 and 2 were transferred successfully as X-type Langmuir−Blodgett films onto quartz slides; such films could have potential applications in optical technology and as biosensors for glycoproteins."

"A new dendron with peripheral long alkyl chains and containing five C60 units in the branching shell has been prepared and attached to a Fréchet-type dendron functionalized with ethylene glycol chains. The peripheral substitution of the resulting globular dendrimer with hydrophobic chains on one hemisphere and hydrophilic groups on the other provides the perfect hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance allowing the formation of stable Langmuir films. Furthermore, a perfect reversibility has been observed in successive compression/decompression cycles. The diblock structure of the dendrimer has been also crucial for the efficient transfer of the Langmuir films in order to obtain well-ordered multilayered Langmuir−Blodgett films. This approach appears particularly interesting since functional groups not well adapted for the preparation of Langmuir and Langmuir−Blodgett films such as fullerenes can be attached into the branching shell of the dendritic structure and, thus, efficiently incorporated in thin ordered films."
"The interfacial properties of the spread Langmuir films of C60Br24 and stearic acid have been studied at air–water interface by measuring their surface pressure–area isotherms. Monolayer studies on C60Br24 suggest a strong aggregation at air–water interface which corroborated the ab initio electron density calculations. The mixed films were found to be immiscible and non-ideal with an exception of XC60Br24=0.5 which is the composition of greater stability. The interaction between C60Br24 and stearic acid results in the lowering of surface pressure withstood by stearic acid and hence the decrease in compressibility with the increasing XC60Br24, thereby indicating the domination of C60Br24 characteristics in the mixed monolayers."

"The synthesis of a series of new C60 derivatives of interest for their potential in the study of LB properties of fullerenes is reported. Besides that of compounds 4b and 4c, featuring fatty acid chains, the preparation of the well-characterized, perfluorinated fulleropyrrolidine 4d is described. A preliminary investigation of LB behavior of the N-acetyl compound 4a gives very promising results."
"A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) coated with Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film of p-allylcalix[4]arene is described for simultaneous determination of traces of thallium and cadmium in environmental water. The LB film electrode in a 0.1 M KH2PO4 solution shows a linear voltammetric response in the range of 5–250 μg l−1 for thallium and 10–300 μg l−1 for cadmium. The detection limits of thallium(I) and cadmium(II) are estimated to be 1.0 μg l−1 (ca. 5.0 × 10−9 M) and 2.2 μg l−1 (ca. 2.0 × 10−8 M), respectively. Above all, the indium does not respond to this LB film electrode."

"We report here the synthesis and characterization of three amphiphilic fullerene derivatives and their Langmuir-Blodgett thin films. Two of the C(60) amphiphiles are mono-derivatives with a long alkyl chain terminated with either -COOH (2) or NH(2) (3) as the hydrophilic headgroup, and the third one (5) is designed to bear the same NH(2) group as 3 but with 10 additional hydrophobic alkyl chains grafted on the C(60) sphere (Scheme 1). These amphiphiles form stable, ordered monolayers at the air-water interface. The molecular packing at the air-water interface and the mean area per molecule are determined by pressure isotherms at room temperature. Hysteresis of pressure isotherms of side chain C(60) (5) shows complete reversibility upon compression and decompression, which suggests that side chains on the C(60) sphere inhibit formation of aggregates at the air-water interface. Comparative studies of all three amphiphiles allow us to better determine the interaction between C(60)'s and their self-assembly kinetics at the air-water interface. Monolayers of monoderivatized amphiphiles (2 and 3) were transferred successfully onto quartz substrates as Z-type multilayered Langmuir-Blodgett films, and monolayers of 5 were transferred as Y-type films. Detailed characterization of the multilayer films (Z-type deposition) prepared from amine-terminated C(60) (3) using X-ray and neutron reflectometry reveals staggering of C(60) spheres and a head-to-head (Y-type) structure presumably due to flipping and reattaching of C(60) amphiphiles to the previous underlying C(60) layer."
"The synthesis of fullerenol with various degrees of hydroxylation and the use of a low hydroxylated product to form stable Langmuir films are reported in this work, along with the optical and electrical properties of Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films obtained on glass and polyaniline (PANI) substrates. The data suggest that an average of 9−12 hydroxyl groups are bound preferentially on one side of the C60 cage and this allows the formation of stable two-layer films at the air/water interface. The large anisotropy of the hydroxylated molecule provides organized LB films of the type substrate−(D−C60−D−C60−)n, with D representing the hydroxyl groups. The electrical conductivity of LB films deposited on glass is equivalent to that reported for highly conductive polymeric C60 but several orders of magnitude higher than that for disordered fullerenol pellets. UV−vis absorptions provide evidence that fullerenol layers cause the deprotonation of PANI, rendering a polymer with low conductivity. The loss of conductivity disagrees with the behavior expected for a donor (PANI)/acceptor (fullerenol) interface, even though current−voltage (I−V) curves of fullerenolLB/PANI junctions indicate some degree of electrical rectification. Additionally, transients observed at large bias on the I−V curves agree with the reported proton conductivity of fullerenol."
"A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film of p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene (TCA) has been investigated as a disposable sensor for measuring the trace levels of lead and cadmium. The possibility of determining lead and cadmium at trace levels was examined with differential pulse stripping voltammetry in the measurement step. The electrochemical response was characterized with respect to supporting electrolyte, pH of solution, accumulation time, accumulation potential, layers of the LB films, and possible interferences. Calibration plots were found to be linear in the range 2 × 10−7 to 5 × 10−5 mol l−1 (Cd2+) and 1 × 10−7 to 2.5 × 10−5 mol l−1 (Pb2+); the detection limits were 2 × 10−8 mol l−1 (Cd2+) and 8 × 10−9 mol l−1 (Pb2+). Possible recognition mechanism was also discussed. From the analysis of real samples (river, lake and tap water) it can be concluded that the method is sensitive and reproducible in determining of these elements and can be used in the analysis of natural water samples."
"The formation of condensed layers of the substituted fullerene 1-t-butyl-9-hydrofullerene-60 at the air/water interface is described. It is shown that high-quality Langmuir-Blodgett films of this material can be built up onto a variety of solid substrates, with deposition ratios of 0.95 ± 0.05 and overall film thickness of up to 200 nm. The room temperature d.c. conductivity has been measured perpendicular to the film plane and established to be of the order 10−10 S cm−1."
"A hydrotalcite clay/dendrimer nanocomposite prepared by the ionic exchange process was adsorbed from suspension of the nanocomposite on a Langmuir monolayer of arachidic acid at the air/water interface, followed by compressing and transferring onto an arachidic acid monolayer Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) film on mica. For comparison, the hydrotalcite-adsorbed hybrid film was also prepared. The morphology of hydrotalcite and the nanocomposite studied by transmission electron microscopy indicated the layered structures with respectively 1.2 ± 0.3 and 3.2 ± 0.5 nm repeating distances. The hybrid Langmuir films displayed the occupied surface area of 0.24 nm2 for both hydrotalcite and the nanocomposite. The formation of hybrid Langmuir films was confirmed by Brewster angle microscopy. Atomic force microscopic images of hybrid LB films revealed the formation of plateau domains with the height difference of 6 nm for hydrotalcite and 12 nm for the nanocomposite and the presence of dendrimers adsorbed on the clay surface of the nanocomposite."
"The microstructural features of the LB films of C60 have been studied by using high resolution electron microscopy. In the ordered regions of the films, lattice fringes of C60 were observed. The selected area electron diffraction patterns possess hexagonal symmetry and can be indexed as a hexagonal unit cell with parameter a=1.0 nm. Defects, dislocations and even more disordered arrangements of C60 can also be observed in the different regions of the films. However, the most parts of the films exist in the amorphous state."
"Langmuir-Blodgett films containing a mixture of fullerene (C60) and arachidic acid (C20H40O2) were deposited on three different substrates (glass, quartz and silicon). The details of the dipping procedure are explained for three different values of the monolayer pressure. Optical studies in air at room temperature on films of various thicknesses deposited on quartz substrates were performed. From transmittivity and reflectivity measurements the refractive index n and extinction coefficient k have been evaluated in the UV-visible spectral range. Finally, a preliminary structural analysis carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the films are homogeneous with some isolated cracks."
"Several methanofullerenes functionalized with either polar or fluorinated groups have been synthesized and their ability to form Langmuir films have been investigated. In both cases, monolayers have been obtained at the gas-water interface. Mixing one of the C60 derivatives grafted by CF2 groups with an amphiphilic fluorinated compound allows the formation of high-quality Langmuir-Blodgett films, with a well defined intrinsic repeat distance along the normal to the substrate."
"Field-effect transistor (FET) device has been fabricated with Langmuir-Blodgett films of C60 dendrimer. The device showed n-channel normally off characteristics with the field-effect mobility of 2.7×10−3cm2V−1s−1 at 300K, whose value is twice as high as that (1.4×10−3cm2V−1s−1) for the FET with spin-coated films of C60 dendrimer. This originates from the formation of ordered π-conduction network of C60 moieties. From the temperature dependence of field-effect mobility, a structural phase transition has been observed at around 300K. Furthermore, the density of states for impurity levels was estimated in the Langmuir-Blodgett films."

"The monolayer and multilayer films of an amphiphilic C60-EDTA (C60EA) and its tetramethyl ester (C60EM) were fabricated on semiconducting transparent ITO electrodes by the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) technique. The photoelectric response of the modified electrodes was measured under various conditions to explore possible mechanisms of the electron transfer in this light harvesting and conversion system. The action spectrum of photocurrent implicates the excited C60EA or C60EM as the photoactive species in the photoinduced electron transfer process. Anodic or cathodic photocurrent could be observed depending on the composition and concentration of redox agents in the solution and/or bias voltage applied. These results suggest that electron flow in either direction is energetically possible in the present photoelectric chemical cell. When the pH in the solution was changed, the photocurrent of C60EA changed not only in its magnitude but also in its direction. Efficient photoinduced electron transfer was observed in the anodic direction. The quantum yields for the photocurrent generation of C60EM and C60EA monolayer−ITO system are 4.80% and 3.80% under favorable conditions."
"Monolayer and multilayer Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of the endohedral metallofullerene Dy@C82 mixed with arachidic acid (Dy@C82/AA) were deposited onto ITO substrates from the N2/water interface. The photoelectrochemical response of the Dy@C82/AA LB films on ITO was investigated. A stable anodic photocurrent was observed, and the effects of bias voltage, light intensity, electron donor, number of layers, and O2 were studied in detail. The results indicate that electrons flow from the electrolyte through the LB film to the ITO electrode. Dy@C82/AA and C60/AA films are compared in terms of the film formation and photoelectric response. Under appropriate conditions, the Dy@C82/AA LB films exhibit a higher photocurrent quantum yield than the C60/AA films on ITO electrodes."
"Both the Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films of two C60-glycine ester derivatives, C60(C6H9NO4) (1) and C60(C8H13NO4) (2), have been prepared at the air/water interface. The Langmuir films can be readily transferred onto hydrophilic quartz substrates in Z type to form LB films. The LB film of 1 has good vertical homogeneity as indicated by UV-VIS spectra and a SHG study. The second- and third-order molecular hyperpolarizabilities β and γ have been determined to be (2.3 ± 1.0) × 10−29, 3.4 × 10−31 esu for 1 and (1.9 ± 0.8) × 10−29, 3.3 × 10−31 esu for 2, respectively."

"Three amphiphilic poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers were synthesized by (1) attaching dodecanoyl chains to a PPI (DAB-dendr-(NH2)8) dendrimer core, (2) reducing the amide groups to secondary amines, and (3) methylating the secondary amines to tertiary amines. Monolayers of all three dendrimers on water were compressed to areas of 160 Å2/molecule. The monolayers of the dendrimers were transferred to newly cleaved mica by the Langmuir−Blodgett method. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that the amphiphilic dendrimers formed stable homogeneous monolayers with surface roughness < 0.5 nm on mica. High-resolution AFM images displayed tetragonal order of a two-dimensional crystal with alkyl chain-to-chain spacing of 0.4−0.5 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments detected glass transitions of the bulk dendrimers in the range of −12 to −60 °C and endothermic transitions from more ordered to less ordered molecular packing at higher temperatures."
"Langmuir-Blodgett films containing C60 and cadmium arachidate were prepared and then exposed to hydrogen sulphide gas to generate cadmium sulphide. The CdS is in the form of nano particles, the blue shift in the absorption spectrum allowing particle size to be calculated. The structural and chemical changes in the film were studied by grazing incidence FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The initial cadmium arachidate and fullerene film did not appear to have the alternate bilayer structure that has been reported for pure arachidic acid and C60. Exposure to H2S also caused some disruption to the film structure with the planes of Cd2+ being drawn into CdS nano-particles."
"Multilayer Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the endohedral metallofullerene [email protected]82 were constructed for the first time at the air–water interface. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy of these films revealed short-range ordered metallofullerene assemblies as well as layered structures. Individual metallofullerenes appeared intact after being transferred from the air–water interface. Blue-shifted UV–vis absorption peaks were observed and attributed to the partial oxidation of the metallofullerene balls."
"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of 1-tert-butyl-1,9-dihydrofullerene-60 are shown to undergo well defined multistage electrochemical reductions to yield the trianion species, with the first two redox waves stable to recycling; these data contrast with those for LB films of the parent system C60."
"The fullerenes, C60 and C70, were prepared with high purity by high performance liquid chromatography. These materials could form condensed layers at the air-water interface. Under appropriate experimental conditions, we have fabricated four species of films, consisting of C60, C70 and their mixtures with arachidic acid, onto various substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The structural characteristics of these films were studied by UV-visible and Fourier transform IR spectroscopies, scanning tunneling microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and low-angle X-ray diffraction measurements."
"Abstract A new voltammetric sensor, Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film of a p‐tert ‐butylcalix[4]arene derivative modified glassy carbon electrode, was designed and successfully used in simultaneous determination of Tl + and Pb 2+ by square‐wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Under the optimum experimental conditions, this newly developed sensor reveal good linear response for Tl + and Pb 2+ in the concentration range of 3×10 −8 –4×10 −6 mol L −1 and 2×10 −7 –2×10 −5 mol L −1 respectively. The detect limits are 2×10 −8 mol L −1 for Tl + and 8×10 −8 mol L −1 for Pb 2+ . Using proposed method, Tl + and Pb 2+ in environment samples were determined with satisfactory results."
"Langmuir and Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of two kinds of C60 derivatives with the substituents which have methoxycarbonyl (C60(I)) and a carboxylic group (C60(II)) were investigated, respectively. The photovoltaic behaviors and charge-transfer process of their LB films on n-type Si substrates and their powders were studied by surface photovoltage spectra (SPS). For the electronic effect caused by different electron-withdrawing groups, they exhibited different photovoltaic behaviors, and the reverse response values of SPS were obtained when the C60-derivatives powders contact with indium tin oxide substrates. The reason was that the relatively strong electron-withdrawing substituent shifted the molecular orbital levels to lower energy, which caused the opposite surface band bending. When deposited on n-Si substrates, the two kinds of C60-derivative LB films both exhibited the same increment on the direct transition of n-Si. Furthermore, the structural characterization of C60(II) LB film was studied in detail by measuring the π−A isotherm, FTIR, and small-angle X-ray diffraction. It revealed that this kind of C60 derivative formed micellar aggregates. The hydrophobic cores of the C60 moiety gave an actual cluster with the hydrophilic substituents sticking out."

"Langmuir−Blodgett films of C60 were doped with potassium, and the doping was followed in situ by both microwave low-field signal (LFS) and electron spin resonance. The superconducting critical temperature was Tc (onset) = 12.9 K for a nominal 14-layer film at optimum doping. The four-probe conductivity of an underdoped film as a function of temperature showed semiconducting behavior."
"Composite Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were prepared from mixtures of fullerene (C60) with various amphiphilic calixarene derivatives having different molecular shape and cavity dimensions. Pressure/ surface area isotherm measurements, ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible optical absorption spectra gave information about the structure and molecular arrangement in the composite LB films. The morphology of films obtained was studied with scanning electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy techniques. It was shown that all calixarene compounds used in the present work are suitable for incorporation of C60 molecules into their matrix, and good-quality LB films can be produced. However, perfect LB films having non-aggregated C60 molecules were obtained only in the case of calix[8]arene matrix, this being due to the formation of a C[8]AC60 inclusion complex."
"The ability to form Langmuir films of a perfluoro C60 derivative has been investigated. Continuous and stepwise compression processes have both exhibited the obtention of a thermodynamically stable monomolecular layer at the air-water interface. Mixed with two equivalents of a fluorinated tetrathiafulvalene derivative, the fullerene compound forms high quality Langmuir-Blodgett films, with a well-defined intrinsic repeat distance along the surface normal of the plane."
"The mechanism of 2,9,16,23-tetra-heptadecylamido-substituted vanadyl phthalocyanine Langmuir–Blodgett film was studied with femtosecond laser pulses. After the excitation into the first electronic excited band, an ultrafast decay due to phonon-exciton coupling greatly affected by temperature was observed. Following this process, exciton-exciton annihilation leads to the recovery of the ground state with a decay time of about 10 ps. The Frenkel exciton theory was employed to give a complete interpretation of the dynamics. An even slower relaxation was also observed."

"A novel cyclic octapeptide carrying a fullerene unit and poly(ethylene glycol) at the side chain (cyclo8-C 60 + PEG) was synthesized, and its monolayer formation at the air/water interface and on a substrate was studied. Surface pressure-area per molecule isotherms indicated that cyclo8-C 60 + PEG formed a stable monolayer at the air/water interface. The cyclo8-C 60 + PEG monolayers prepared from various spreading volumes (i.e., from various initial areas per molecule) overlapped nicely on a single curve, suggesting that the molecules were uniformly dispersed on the surface without aggregation of the fullerene units. The uniform dispersibility is due to the scaffold effect of the cyclic peptide unit to keep the fullerene units away from each other. The formed monolayer could be quantitatively transferred onto a solid substrate. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) monolayer showed that the electronic structure of the fullerene unit was not affected by the formation of the monolayer. Cyclic voltammetry of the LB monolayer in an aqueous solution containing redox species indicated that the LB monolayer was densely packed. Furthermore, reversible redox peaks attributed to the one-electron reduction of the fullerene unit were observed, showing that the redox property of the fullerene unit was also retained in the monolayer. It is thus concluded that the cyclic peptide is a good candidate as a scaffold for stable monolayer formation at the air/water interface and for intact immobilization of the fullerene moiety onto a substrate."
"Organic thin film solar cells composed of the hetero-deposited Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were fabricated using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor, [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor and poly(N-dodecylacrylamide) (pDDA) as an amphiphilic polymer. Various types of the solar cell such as the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type, p-n heterojunction type, double layer BHJ type and P3HT single layer type solar cells were constructed and their photovoltaic properties were compared with them. The short circuit current densities observed at all the solar cells fabricated by LB technique were three orders of magnitude smaller than that of BHJ solar cell fabricated by spin-coating method because of the film resistance of the existence of pDDA for forming LB film. The open circuit voltage is interestingly obtained to be 1.23, 0.82 and 1.06 V at the P3HT single layer type, p-n heterojunction type and the double layer BHJ type solar cells fabricated by LB technique, resulting to be higher than 0.52 V at the BHJ type solar cell. The phenomena demonstrate that the hole produced by photoinduced charge separation can be accumulated at the P3HT layer of the solar cells."
"Abstract A new type of voltammetric sensor, Langmuir–Blodgett film of p‐tert‐ butylthiacalix[4]arene modified glassy carbon electrode, was advanced and used for determining copper at trace levels by differential pulse stripping voltammetry. Calibration plot was found to be linear in the range of 2×10 −8 M to 5×10 −6 M; the detection limit was 2×10 −9 M. Possible recognition mechanism was also discussed. From determination of Copper in real samples (river, lake and tap water) it can be concluded that the method is rapid, sensitive in determining of copper and can be used in the analysis of natural water samples."
"The formation of molecular aggregate behavior of the substituted fullerene 1,3,6,11,13,18,28,31-octabromofullerene-C60(C60Br8) at the air-water interface is described. It is shown that C60Br8 (1.0 × 10−4M) forms a monomolecular thickness and that C60Br8 (1.0 × 10−3M) forms multilayers. The in-plane electrical conductivity of Langmuir-Blodgett films at different conditions has been measured and established to be of the order of 10−3 to 10−5 S cm−1."
"Abstract A C60-bearing artificial lipid 1 forms stable monolayers at the air-water interface both in the dark and in the light. The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film prepared in the dark showed a phase transition by which the electronic interaction between the fullerene moieties was controllable. The LB film prepared in the light exhibited structureless electronic spectra with almost no temperature dependence."
"There are several kinds of materials and devices requiring a peculiar and specific organization of active moieties, which is accomplished through distinctive techniques. A well-known example is represented by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique that nowadays is described as a frontier method for the deposition of ultra-thin and homogeneous films with a pre-determined architecture, composition, thickness and usually with a resulting elevated level of anisotropy. Another impressive aspect is that the LB technique is among the few methods allowing the realization of different electrical conjunctions between the two ends of a single molecule."
"The first series of carbosilane liquid crystal codendrimers with groups of different polarity has been synthesized. The chemical structure of the newly synthesized materials and the composition of the codendrimers were studied by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS. It was found that the codendrimers tend to form stable Langmuir films at the air-water surface. The influence of composition and generation number on surface pressure-surface area isotherms and film stability was studied. Brewster angle microscopy confirmed the different phase behavior for monolayers of different codendrimer composition and generation number. It was found that side groups of fifth-generation codendrimers do not segregate, unlike those of lower generations. Langmuir-Blodgett films on solid substrates were obtained by the vertical dipping method. X-ray diffraction showed that the codendrimers with 75% of hydrophobic mesogenic terminal groups formed ordered layers parallel to the substrate."
"A stable Langmuir monolayer of fullerene C60 and an artificial lipid was formed at the air–water interface and the monolayer was transferred onto an electrode as a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film. Here, we focus on the importance of cationic matrix lipid films to the facile electrochemistry of C60 embedded in a LB film of cationic lipids on an electrode in aqueous media. The electrochemically generated radical monoanion of C60 embedded in a film of cationic lipid, tridodecylmethylammonium bromide (1), was stable during continuous potential cycling, while the C60 radical monoanion became unstable after the generation of C602− due to the exfoliation of the LB film from the electrode. On the basis of the electrolyte dependence and the charge dependence of the matrix lipids, a possible electron-transfer mechanism for the C60/artificial lipid LB film-modified electrodes is presented."
"The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of C60 mixed with stearic acid (SA) on a water subphase are deposited on optical glass substrates and their UV-Vis absorption spectra are measured. The surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of C60 LB films has been observed for the first time. Silver-island film is used to obtain SERS of a well-ordered single-monolayer C60 LB film. The SERS contain all fundamental Raman modes, as well as several new weak bands attributed to higher-order Raman modes as determined from factor group analysis. The enhancement of higher-order Raman scattering is probably related to C60 molecular structure. The present results illustrate the potential of SRES in detecting monolayer C60 LB films and in obtaining complete C60 Raman spectra."
"Two C60 derivatives, dodecylaminofullerene (DAF) and multihydroxydodecylaminofullerene (MHDAF) were prepared. The isotherms showed that the limiting molecular areas of DAF and MHDAF are around 60 Å2 and 64.7 Å2 respectively, which suggests that the aggregations of the molecules at the air-water interface are decreased compared with that of C60. The best transfer ratio could be enhanced to 0.7–1 by using the vertical dipping method. The structural characteristics of DAF Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The second-order susceptibility χ(2) and molecular hyperpolarizability (β) of 12-layer LB films of DAF are determined to be 3.26 × 10−6 esu and 1.46 × 10−28 esu respectively."
"We present here a multi-technique investigation of C60-based Langmuir–Blodgett films. C60–(CH2)2–N–(CH2–CH2–O)3–CH3 films were investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM), static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The aim was to test the ability of this fullerene-derivative to form a stable monolayer to be transferred to a solid substrate. In fact, AFM measurements revealed a clustering of molecules when a single dipping was done. The C60-derivative could be detected by SSIMS as a whole and as separated fragments of C60 and hydrophilic heads and, finally, XPS enabled to measure the film thickness and to chemically characterize the film surface."
"A new amphiphilic derivative of fullerene C60 bearing an oligoglycyl tail (C60CHCOgly2OEt, 2) formed stable Langmuir floating films at the air–water interface. This occurred when the molecular assembly was stabilized by anchoring the amphiphilic C60's to the aqueous subphase, via hydrogen bonding interactions between a dipeptide (Gly–L–Leu) dissolved in the water subphase, and the oligoglycyl chain. The compression (π−A) isotherm of the Langmuir floating film constructed in such a way showed no hysteresis, was steep, and evidenced that the monolayer collapsed at a surface pressure π⩾65 mN m−1, thus confirming that the film was tightly packed, extremely stable, and rigid. A limiting area per molecule of 89.1 Å2 was extrapolated, in agreement with the calculated cross-section area of the C60 fullerene. On the contrary, when the dipeptide was absent and pure water was used as the subphase, the π−A isotherm yielded a limiting area <55 Å2 which indicated the formation of multiple layers; moreover it showed significant hysteresis, the film was fragile, and it collapsed at π≈50 mN m−1. Once anchored by the dipeptide, the floating monolayer of 2 could be transferred onto hydrophobic quartz, glass and silicon substrates, by successive vertical dipping cycles, each cycle made up of two down-strokes and two up-strokes, to yield the Langmuir–Blodgett film. Up to 200 down- and up-strokes could be repeated reproducibly, a noteworthy result for non-covalently assembled LB films of fullerenes. The transfer ratio was 1.0, except for the second down-stroke of each cycle that gave a transfer ratio of zero, making the sequence of successful transfers: D, U, U, (cleaning and spreading), D, U, U, (cleaning and spreading), and so on (D=down-stroke, U=up-stroke). The total number of deposited layers was therefore 150. X-ray diffraction spectra were registered and exhibited a peak, which was fitted by a Montecarlo method of simulation to obtain the distribution of the repeat unit responsible for scattering; such distribution, with thickness between 20 and 60 Å, was consistent with the size of the amphiphile and the transfer sequence. The UV–Vis spectra of the LB film exhibited the characteristic C60 bands, and the absorption peaks in the 200–400 nm range were proportional to the number of layers, indicating that the deposition was reproducible and that the molecular environment of C60 in each layer remained constant."
"Two kinds of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and a Langmuir–Blodgett film of fullerene derivative C61(COOH)2 that have the photoelectric conversion property were first reported here. The SAMs were either fabricated directly on hydrophilic indium–tin-oxide (ITO), quartz, and mica by esterification reaction or on the aminopropylsilanated substrates by amide bonds. The SAMs were characterized by contact angle, AFM, UV spectrum and cyclic voltammetry. The film thickness calculated by molecular mechanic with the MM2 method in Molgen 4.0 coincided with that obtained by AFM measurement, indicating the formation of monolayer. All of three systems can generate stable cathodic photocurrent. The separated charge loss process in our systems is monomolecule recombination."
"A novel amphiphilic C60 derivative, C60−AOOA, was prepared for Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films by a thermally reversible Diels−Alder reaction of C60 and an anthracene derivative with a carboxylic acid group side chain. This derivative showed a limiting surface area per molecule (at zero pressure) as large as 0.92 nm2, which is reasonable for a true Langmuir monolayer of a C60 derivative. LB films were formed on various substrates. Their structure and thermal behavior were studied by X-ray diffraction and FT-IR: the transferred C60−AOOA decomposes upon heat treatment, to form a C60 layer and/or C60/C60−AOOA mixed layers."
"The photoelectrochemical response of a C60 iminodiacetic acid ester derivative (C60IDA), deposited on ITO electrodes by means of the Langmuir—Blodgett technique, has been investigated. The anodic photocurrent observed on the modified electrode corresponds to an electron transfer from the electrolyte through the LB film to the electrode. The action spectrum of photocurrent indicates C60IDA as the photoactive species in the photoinduced electron transfer process. Positive bias voltage, reducing agent and higher pH of the solution are beneficial factors for generating higher photocurrent. The quantum yield for photocurrent generation is 0.94% and can be raised to 3.40% under favorable conditions."
"A thermal dissociation method was employed to fabricate the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of C60. A C60 adduct with an amphiphilic anthracene bearing a carboxylic group (C60−AN) was synthesized as the precursor molecule. C60−AN formed a monolayer at the air−water interface. The monolayers were transferred on solid substrates to form LB films using a horizontal lifting method. The LB films were subjected to heat treatments and their structural change was investigated by using UV−visible and IR spectroscopies. Most of the C60−AN molecules were dissociated to C60 and amphiphilic anthracenes at 100 °C, followed by the exclusion of the anthracene moiety from the LB films. The thermal dissociation proceeded more at higher temperatures. At 200 °C, the dissociation proceeded completely, although a certain form of hydrocarbon remained in the LB films. All the materials disappeared when the films were heated above 350 °C."
"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the fullerene (C60) were formed with a variety of matrices. The pure C60 formed a collapsed film at the air-water interface and the transferred film had an inhomogeneous surface. By mixing with icosanoic acid, the monolayers were transferred onto substrates with good quality and the resultant LB films had a smooth surface. The 1:1 mixture with dioctadecyldimethylammonium-ClO4 was deposited as Z-type film onto substrates. The film is, however, composed of doughnut-shaped aggregates for a single-layered sample. Multilayered samples had undulations of ca. 100 nm. The absorption spectra of both of the mixed films were in good agreement with those of evaporated films. The LB films with a long-alkyl γ-cyclodextrin were also examined."
"A novel class of crown ether-bearing [60]fulleropyrrolidine containing benzothiazolium styryl dye has first been synthesized and characterized. Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett films of the compounds can be produced and surface pressure-area isotherms of the compounds are obtained. The compounds can form excellent Langmuir monolayers on pure water subphase. The area of per molecule increases with addition of KCl to the water subphase. UV–vis spectra are employed for LB films characterization, which disclose good quality films."

"Various doping methods were used in order to realize the charge transfer between C 60 molecules and alkali-metal atoms in the Langmuir-Blodgett structure. ESR measurements have clearly indicated the charge transfer in the samples heated with RbN 3 powder. The development of the metallic region in these films, possibly in the form of o -Rb 1 C 60 , has been indicated, for the first time, by the obtained Pauli-like spin susceptibility and the Elliott-like ESR linewidth. Furthermore, hysteresis was observed in the low-magnetic-field microwave absorption signal (LFS) for a sample, showing the appearance of the superconducting phase with T c ≈23 K in the sample tube."
"A new C60−sarcosine methyl ester derivative, C60(C5H9NO2) (1), was prepared, and its Langmuir films with and without dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODMAB) were formed at the air/water interface. Pure 1 forms monolayer or multilayer films depending on the experimental conditions. The 1:1 mixed Langmuir film of 1 and DODMAB was transferred onto hydrophilic quartz substrates both in Z and Y type. Macroscopic second-harmonic generation from the mixed LB film was observed, and the second-order molecular susceptibility χ(2) and hyperpolarizability β were evaluated to be (2.1 ± 0.8) × 10-7 and (1.2 ± 0.4) × 10-28 esu. The first observations of room-temperature photoluminescence of 1 from both the mixed LB film and its CHCl3 solution and its fluorescence quenching by concentration and N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) were reported. Its singlet energy is estimated to be 40.2 kcal/mol. Its fluorescence lifetime in CHCl3 solution is determined to be 1.0 ± 0.3 ns using the frequency-domain method."
"A new 4-acetalphenyl substituted C60-pyrrolidine derivative C60(C12H17NO2) (1) was prepared and characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FDMS, FTIR and UV-vis spectra. Its Langmuir film study indicates that it can form stable monolayer at the air/water interface, which can be transferred onto hydrophilic substrates to form LB films. The LB monolayer exhibits weak second harmonic generation (SHG). Its second-order susceptibility χpp(2) is evaluated to be 6 × 10−9 esu."
"Dendrimers represent a new class of synthetic macromolecules characterized by a regularly branched treelike structure. Peculiar features of the dendritic geometry are the large number of end groups as well as the shape persistence in higher generations, approaching spherical geometry. And one of the most peculiar characteristics of dendritic macromolecules is their controlled molecular structure and orientation, which means that they have a practical application in achieving a highly organized molecular arrangement. We attempted to fabricate a G4-48PyA dendrimer Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films containing 48 pyridinealdoxime functional end group that could form a complex structure with metal ions. Also, we investigated the surface activity of dendrimer films at air-water interface. And we have studied the electrical properties of the ultra-thin dendrimer LB films. The electrical properties of the ultra-thin dendrimer LB films were investigated by studying the current–voltage characteristics of metal/dendrimer LB films/metal (MIM) structure. The rectifying behavior of the devices was occurred in applied field. And result in change of electrical properties by the effect of complex with metal ions."
"The Langmuir films of a fullerene dicarboxylic acid derivative I, C60(HOOCCHNH2CHCOOH)CF3SO3H (FDA), at the air/water interface have been investigated. FDA formed a stable monolayer on pure water when dilute solution (1.04 x 10(-5) mol/L) was used as the spreading solution. The monolayer formation on various subphases was investigated, including solutions containing different monovalent (Na+, Ag+) and divalent (Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+) cations. The introduction of these cations makes the monolayer more stable. The limiting molecular area is also dependent on the pH of the subphase. The surface pressure versus area isotherms at different temperature clearly indicate that FDA molecules easily aggregate at high temperature. The monolayer and multilayer LB films of FDA were deposited on quartz and glass substrates from Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, or Cu2+/Phen solution subphase, and their UV-vis and XPS spectra were obtained. The data showed that for Cd2+ and Cu2+/Phen subphase the cation can be transferred onto the substrates together with FDA but not the other two. The photoelectrochemical behavior of FDA on an ITO electrode was investigated, which showed that the photocurrent is cathodic. Oxygen and negative bias are beneficial factors for the photocurrent generation. The external quantum yield is ca. 4%. Copyright 1998 Academic Press."
"This work presents the first results of an ellipsometric investigation of fullerene embedded Langmuir–Blodgett films with surface plasmon excitation. In contrast to standard ellipsometry, the angle Δ obtained in this way has pronounced features observed at the C60 transitions."
"Abstract The synthesis of a series (1–5) of fullerene and Zn(II)‐porphyrin amphiphiles with polar dibenzo[24]crown‐8 headgroups is described. Their ability to form Langmuir monolayers at the air‐water interface was investigated in a systematic study. The Langmuir films were characterized by their surface pressure versus molecular area isotherms, compression and expansion cycles, and Brewsterangle microscopy. Complexation of larger alkali metal cations (K + and Cs + ) by the polar headgroups leads to higher molecular area requirements and a better anchoring to the aqueous subphase. The monolayers of the porphyrin‐(dibenzo[24]crown‐8) conjugates were transferred as Langmuir—Blodgett films onto glass slides and the films characterized by UV‐vis spectroscopy and grazing‐incidence X‐ray diffraction. Good evidence was obtained that the porphyrin‐fullerene‐crown ether triad 5 adopts a sandwich geometry in the LB films. In such an arrangement, the electron‐attracting carbon sphere benefits from attractive interactions with the sandwiching electron‐rich porphyrin and crown ether chromophores. The described films could have potential applications as functional materials in optical and electronic technology."
"Langmuir (L) and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of fullerene C60–oligo-para-phenylenevinylene (OPV) derivative with six C12H25 aliphatic chains were characterized. For the Langmuir films, isotherms of surface pressure versus molecular area, compression/expansion cycles (hysteresis curves) and Brewster angle microscopic images were obtained. We performed molecular mechanics and density functional theory calculations to determine the molecular and electronic structure of our compound at a water–air interface. We found agreement between experimental and theoretical values for the molecular surface area. LB films of up to ten layers were obtained on glass substrates, and were characterized by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. We observed that the absorbance at a wavelength of 326 nm grows almost linearly as a function of the number of layers. Films on glass-indium tin oxide were characterized by atomic force microscopy. We also observed a uniform deposition over the whole area of the scanned substrate. We demonstrated that the fullerene C60–OPV derivative is able to form both L and LB films preventing fullerene aggregation with its aliphatic chains. We suggest that, due to its electron-acceptor properties, the C60–OPV derivative could be used for organic–photovoltaic and organic–electronic applications."

"The ability to form Langmuir films of new C60 derivatives functionalized by mesogenic groups has been investigated. Multilayer organizations were obtained when dilute solutions of these pure compounds had been spread at the gas/water interface. However, they formed monomolecular films when they were diluted with an amphiphilic compound which interacts with their respective functional groups. Langmuir—Blodgett (LB) films (Z type) have been built starting with such monolayers. UV—Vis absorption spectra of the LB films exhibited a red shift of the fullerene bands by comparison with those of the chloroform solutions. The absence of the characteristic absorption peak of fullerene aggregates in the spectrum of the LB films indicates that C60 derivatives have been transferred in the monomeric form."
"A new substrate of "gold nano-particle/silver nano-rod/ITO surface" was obtained by electrodeposition. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum of high quality of C60 and stearic acid (SA) mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film shifted onto the new substrate was reported for the first time according to our knowledge. The results show that the substrate of "gold nano-particle/silver nano-rod/ITO surface" is very effective and active for C60 LB film. Furthermore, the C60 molecules are oriented on pentagons of C60 on the substrate. It is difficult to separate the electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms to the great enhancement of the Raman signal. On the one hand, the gold nano-particles grown on silver nano-rod surface perform an important action for magnifying the surface local electric field through the resonant excitation of surface plasma. And the needle-like rod may further magnify the local electric field because of lightning rod effect. On the other hand, charge transfer factor may not be neglected."
"Abstract A new type of voltammetric sensor, Langmuir‐Blodgett (LB) film of 5,11,17,23‐tetra‐ tert ‐butyl‐25,27‐di(3‐thiadiazole‐propanoxy)‐26,28‐dihydroxycalix[4]arene modified glassy carbon electrode (LB TZCA –GCE), was prepared. The electrochemical properties of LB TZCA –GCE were researched in detail and its recognizing mechanism for silver ion in aqueous solution was discussed. Using this voltammetric sensor, a new stripping voltammetric method for determining of Ag + was erected with good sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and recovery. The detection limit was 8×10 −9 M at accumulation time of 180 s. By this method, real samples (lake water, tap water and synthesis sample) were analyzed and the results obtained were well satisfactory."
"pi-A isotherms, transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) images and photoluminescence spectra of a mixed Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of C(60) and stearic acid (SA) deposited on silicon substrate have been measured at room temperature. C(60)/SA nanoparticles aggregated and formed an ordered net-like structure when deposited on silicon substrate. Two PL intense bands centered at 731 and 806nm, respectively, which are rare at room temperature, were obtained. It is supposed that the particular ordered net-like construction of the LB film plays a crucial role in the enhancement of the photoluminescence. The 731nm PL band is related with the aggregation state of the particles and the 806nm PL band is referred as the intrinsic PL spectrum of the C(60)."
"Three mixtures of the endohedral metallofullerene [email protected]82 and arachidic acid (AA) with different molar ratios have been investigated at the air–water interface in the presence of Cd2+ in the aqueous subphase. Compared with the pure [email protected]82, the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the mixtures with AA were easily fabricated by the vertical dipping method. The structural characteristics of these films were studied by UV–Vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements. When the molar ratio AA:[email protected]82 exceeds 2:1, the corresponding LB films exhibit an ordered layer structure."
"Langmuir films have been prepared using pure C60 and arachidic acid mixed with C60 in the ratio of 1 : 1 and 4.2 : 1. Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films were then deposited on a variety of substrates with Y-type deposition being observed. Films containing bilayers of arachidic acid alternating with both single and double monolayers of C60 were prepared. The structure of the arachidic acid component in the mixed films was investigated by grazing-incidence FTIR spectroscopy and was shown to be similar to that in an LB film of pure arachidic acid. The absence of structural disruption in the presence of C60 provides strong evidence for an ordered alternant arrangement of fullerenes and arachidic acid in the films."
"Amphiphiles with a dendritic structure are attractive materials as they combine the features of dendrimers with the self-assembling properties and interfacial behavior of water-air affinities. We have synthesized three generations of polyester dendrimers and studied their interfacial properties on the Langmuir films. The behavior obtained was, as a rule, the lowest generation dendrimers behaving like traditional amphiphiles and the larger molecules presenting complicated isotherms. The Langmuir films of these compounds have been characterized by their surface pressure versus molecular area (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>) and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) observations."

"The amphiphilic nature of a [Ru(bpy)3]2+-C60 dyad, namely, a hydrophobic fulleropyrrolidine core covalently linked to a hydrophilic [Ru(bpy)3]2+ chromophore, through a trioxyethylene spacer, secures a controllable two-dimensional crystal growth of the dyad molecules at the air−water interface. The existence of a truly monolayered structure was confirmed by means of surface pressure (Π) versus surface area (A) isotherms and as well as by Brewster angle microscopy. A limiting area of 117 Å2/molecule for dyad 2 is in satisfactory agreement with that reported for pristine C60 (93 Å2/molecule). Brewster angle microscopy reveals, upon compression of the monolayer to the point of collapse, a phase transition. In particular, the dyad monolayer transforms into threadlike fibers, which align perpendicular to the compression direction. Two-dimensional AFM images suggest that the dyad fibers are composed of close-packed several hundred μm long and 1.0 ± 0.2 μm wide clusters, which in turn consist of nanosized dyad clusters, with diameters of 100 ± 20 nm."
"A new kind of amphiphilic polymer was synthesized. Its center core was N-vinyl-2-Pyrrolidone/ß-hydroxyethyl (VPy-HMA) hydrophilic microgel and the arms on the core were hydrophobic PSt chains. It was found that this amphiphilic polymer could be reformed into monolayers of “reversed duckweed” type on the air-water interface, and its Langmuir-Blodget films had a good laminar structure."
"A novel C 60 pyrrolidine derivative, C 60 (C 8 H 15 NO 2 ) (1), has been synthesized and its Langmuir and LB films were investigated. The monolayer of 1 can be transferred on to hydrophilic substrates. Photocurrent generation of the LB film modified ITO electrode has been measured. The anodic photocurrent can be suppressed by oxygen and enhanced by the electron donor Vc (ascorbic acid). The quantum yield is 1.9% with the concentration of Vc at 0.5 mg ml -1 in the KCl solution."

"The structural and optical nonlinear features of the condensed layers at the air−water interface and Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) films of the substituted fullerene 1-benzyl-9-hydrofullerene-60 (C60-Be) were investigated by π−A isotherm, small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD), and optical measurements. Pure C60-Be molecules existed at the air−water interface in a bulk phase. A new type of two-chain amphiphilic molecule, 1,10-bistearyl-4,6,13,15-tetraene-18-nitrogen-crown-6 (NC), was used as an inert material to construct mixed C60-Be/NC LB films of much better quality than the pure C60-Be LB films. Our π−A, UV−visible absorption, and SAXD measurements show that the structural improvement in the mixed C60-Be/NC LB films was realized by insertion of the C60-Be molecules between the two hydrophobic chains of the NC molecules. The relatively large third-order nonlinear susceptibility χ(3)xxxx(−3ω;ω,ω,ω) = 2.1 × 10-11 esu was deduced by measuring third-harmonic generation in the mixed C60-Be/NC LB films."
"Linear and non-linear coupling of a waveguide coated with a C60 Langmuir-Blodgett film is investigated from 2 to 20 mW using the 514.5 nm line of an argon ion laser. The results show that non-linear coupling occurs when the input power in increased to 6 mW and extends to 14 mW. This property of a lower threshold for non-linear coupling to occur may be used for power limitation or in an optical switch in guided-wave optics."
"Thermal behaviors of 11-layer Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of the double long-chain compounds of octadecylammonium laurate (ODALA), octadecylammonium octadecanoate (ODASA) and octadecylammonium tetracosanoate (ODATA) have been investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The temperature-dependent infrared spectra show that thermal stability of the three kinds of LB films depends upon the length of the hydrocarbon chain. The LB film of ODALA undergoes an order–disorder transition in the temperature range of 50–65 °C. In contrast, the ODATA LB film has the phase transition temperature range of 80–90 °C. Of particular interest is that both ODASA and ODATA LB films have nearly the same phase transition temperature range of 80–90 °C, indicating that the replacement between tetracosanoic acid and stearic acid has little effect on the thermal stability of the two compounds. The above observations suggest that the effective length of the alkyl chains, which is determined by the component with a shorter chain in the double long-chain compounds, has a dominant influence on the thermal stability. It is very likely that the whole chain of the shorter chain component such as octadecylamine in ODATA has contribution to the thermal stability while only the effective length of the longer alkyl chain component gives a significant effect."
"We studied, by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the changes in the molecular arrangement of arachidic acid ( C 20 ) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film with increasing quantity of pyrrole (Py) molecules which we used as spacer molecules for C 20 molecules in the LB film. When the concentration of Py molecules in the C 20 LB film was increased from 0% to 150%, the crystal structure of the LB film changed as follows: oblique lattice→hexagonal lattice→square lattice. These observations agreed qualitatively with the results of computer simulation based on molecular mechanics. Precise control of the crystal structure of LB film by adjusting the number of spacer molecules such as Py in the LB film is possible."

"To examine the issues like the shape of the CdS clusters, time and thickness dependence of chemical conversion and to study the correlation between the pre and post sulfidation structure of the LB films on CdS formation, a set of multilayer cadmium arachidate LB films grown with different morphology and thickness have been studied using AFM, TEM, X-ray reflectivity and XPS. Microscopic evidence of formation of nearly uniform CdS nanoparticles of around 4.5 nm in the LB matrix was observed. In relatively compact films, mount like structures were found to develop due to out-of-plane molecular motion, whereas, for non compact films, expansion and molecular rearrangement appears to reduce the height non-uniformity and smooth out the surface as a result of sulfidation. Full conversion of cadmium arachidate to CdS was not achieved in the LB matrix even after a long exposure and the time required for conversion was found to be independent of film thickness, both contrary to the earlier observation. A partial conversion of a maximum of around 60% could be achieved in the films of various thickness and compactness indicating that partial survival of the layered structure after sulfidation may be possible in initially compact films."
"Langmuir−Blodgett (L−B) films prepared from 18,18,18-trifluorooctadecanoic acid [CF3(CH2)16COOH], perfluorotetradecanoic acid [n-C13F27COOH], or octadecanoic acid [n-C17H35COOH] were used as target surfaces for hyperthermal ion−surface collisions. The synthesis of 18,18,18-trifluorooctadecanoic acid and the preparation of the L−B film from this compound using a subphase containing Al3+ are reported in this paper. The Ion−surface collision results show that the outermost surface group, namely CF3 vs CH3, is the main determinant for the efficiency of both energy transfer and electron transfer during low-energy (e.g., 10−100 eV) polyatomic ion−surface collisions. For atomic projectile ions, there is evidence of penetration into a depth of the films."
"Abstract In this Paper we report optical dichroism and polarized resonance Raman scattering measurements on Langmuir-Blodgett layers of tetra tertiary butyl monosulphonic acid of phthalocyanine (tBPcSA). These measurements were performed to determine molecular alignment and local ordering in our samples, using surface enhanced optical and Raman spectroscopy. Thus our L-B layers were deposited on rough thin (50 Å) Ag island films. We found that the surface enhancement effects dominated the optical behaviour of our samples, making it more difficult to extract the desired information on molecular orientation. At the same time, we found that tBPcSA L-B layers can be a good system to study resonance effects and to test the reliability of the structural information obtainable by optical spectroscopic techniques."
"Abstract The multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of poly 3-(2-(5-chlorobenzotriazole)ethyl) thiophene (PCBET) blended with amphibious arachidic acid (AA) were prepared and characterized. The photoluminescence intensity of the blend film was enhanced as the AA increased by a certain amount. The PCBET excimers were not formed in the blend LB films."
"Abstract Langmuir-Blodgett films of mesomorphic side-chain polymethacrylates are investigated from the point of view of their phase change versus temperature via X-ray and neutron reflectivity. Upon heating, “thick” films undergo an irreversible transition towards the well known smectic Al lamellar phase. In contrast a bilayer deposited onto a solid substrate appears to be very stable upon annealing. Such a behaviour is believed to induce an epitaxial mechanism when cooling “thick” Rims from the isotropic melt phase."

"Nanometer-scale lithography was performed by applying the local electric field of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to an oligosilane Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film composed of tridecamethylhexasilanylacetic acid ( MeSi 6 AA) transferred onto a facet of a gold single crystal. After halting the probe tip and applying a higher bias voltage than is usual for STM imaging with feedback on, holes with diameters of 30–50 nm appeared. The formation of the holes depended on the polarity and bias applied. These results are accounted for because the electron beam emitted from the tip under high electric field broke the LB film. It was also discovered that fixation of the tip by making the feedback off could create holes with diameters of less than 10 nm."

"The Langmuir-Blodgett technique was used to study the molecular organization of a mixed 3-hexadecyl pyrrole (3HDP) and ferrocene-derivatized pyrrole (Fc-Py) surfactant system. It has been determined that stable monolayer films of the mixed system could be formed at the air-water interface. The growth and assembly process led to polypyrrole 2-D lattices with heretofore unsurpassed order. In fact, the process of template polymerization, it appears, leads to a new crystal phase for the polypyrrole component of the thin film structure. Various monolayer and multilayer films were prepared on platinum-coated substrates for surface spectroscopic characterization. Near Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) studies revealed that highly ordered multilayer structures are being formed. Electrochemical studies have been initiated to determine the feasibility of these films in molecular electronic device applications."

"In this communication, we demonstrate an approach for shape control of PbTe nanocrystals. We succeeded in synthesizing three different shapes of PbTe nanoparticles, including cubes, cuboctahedra, and octahedra. These morphologies were prepared by changing the molar ratio between the Pb and Te precursors and also by changing the surfactant. Langmuir−Blodgett films were prepared using these PbTe nanocrystals."

"Abstract The electrical properties of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polypyrrole and poly N-methylpyr-role fabricated on a manganic stearate template in the LB film has been studied. The LB films of polymer exhibit domains of highly organised two dimensional linear array of polymer granules sandwiched between insulating fatty acid layers along with some disorganised domains. Measured in-plane conductivity of polypyrrole and poly N-methylpyrrole are 1.5 S/cm and 0.012 S/cm with thermal activation energy 0.08 eV and 0.214 eV respectively. The transverse conductivity is 10−10 S/cm and 10−12 S/cm for polypyrrole and poly N-methylpyrrole respectively showing a high degree of anisotropy in both the LB films."
"The time evolution of void structures in highly purified polymer latex dispersions was studied with a confocal laser scanning microscope. In such dispersions, which were initially homogeneous, the voids grew with time when the dispersions were kept standing and formed more quickly in the internal material than in material close to the glass-dispersion interface. Void formation is thus not an artifact arising from the presence of the interface. A similar structural inhomogeneity, in apparently homogeneous systems, is discussed for simple ionic solutions, ionic polymer solutions, and Langmuir-Blodgett films."

"This paper describes a study of the effects of pressure and temperature on the shear strength of very thin layers of a number of lubricants. The shear strength is deduced from measurements of the tangential (frictional) force required to slide glass spheres over glass plates coated with the lubricant. It is assumed that no glass-glass contact occurs through the lubricant film and that the area of lubricant sheared is the geometrical contact area determined by the elastic constants of the sliding surfaces. Consequently by varying the radius of the sphere and the normal load the contact pressure can be varied from 10 7 to 5 x 10 9 Pa (1 Pa = 1 Nm -2 ). The results show that the shear strength of Langmuir-Blodgett films of calcium stearate is constant at low pressures, but at pressures greater than 5 x 10 7 Pa it increases approximately in proportion to the pressure. At higher temperatures the behaviour is similar but the shear strength is reduced at all pressures. Similar experiments have been carried out on retracted stearic acid films, on vapour deposited sebacic acid films and on smeared films of copper stearate and anthracene. Thin films of high density polythene and PTFE have also been studied. For these materials both the absolute value of the shear strength and its variation with pressure resemble the behaviour of calcium stearate. Experiments on the effect of temperature on the shear strength show that calcium stearate, stearic acid and high density polythene exhibit similar ‘activation energies’ for the shear process. This suggests that these materials all shear by a similar process involving the sliding of linearly orientated methylene groups over one another. PTFE behaves in a similar way although its ‘activation energy’ is a little higher. By contrast anthracene and sebacic acid have much lower activation energies suggesting that a different shear process is involved."
"Amphiphilic diblock copolymers containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and saturated polybutadiene (PBD) hydrophobic chains have been cross-linked in both monolayer and bilayer assemblies. For monolayers, the Langmuir isotherm proves consistent with prior measures of density and compressibility for bilayer vesicles, and the monolayers can be macroscopically transferred as Langmuir−Blodgett films. Since the films are inverted (PBD oriented away from the slide) at the air−water interface, they spontaneously reorganize when immersed in water into wormlike micelles. However, this transition is quenched when the film is stabilized by free radical polymerization. Atomic force microscopy shows a stabilized but pitted film, which allows height measurements that prove consistent with a monolayer. With bilayer vesicles, we investigate several additional aspects of cross-linking. Spatial control of membrane cross-linking on the micrometer-scale is demonstrated by dynamic inflation−deflation of a membrane fixed to the end of a micropipet. Complete polymerization of the bilayer renders vesicles resilient to chloroform solubilization, whereas preblending with a non-cross-linkable diblock copolymer of PEO−polylactic acid, undermines vesicle stability in chloroform−water solutions. The results prove miscibility and stable integration of two disparate block copolymers in a membrane, as well as a first-order scheme for controlled release of encapsulants."
"Communication: Orientation of chromophores by using the Langmuir‐Blodgett film‐prepration procedure, to a degree practically impossible to achieve by poling in polymer matrices in an electric field, has held to materials exhibiting the highest values of the second order susceptibility (χ (2) ) yet known.

"Absorption, fluorescence and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy has been applied to quasi two-dimensional Langmuir–Blodgett monolayers and three-dimensional arrangements of Langmuir–Blodgett films with different numbers of layers. Pure dye films of pheophorbide-a and films in which pheophorbide-a molecules were embedded in a behenic acid matrix have been investigated. Optical spectroscopy is used in order to obtain evidence for intra- and interlayer interaction in the membrane-like environment and distinguish between these different types of interactions. Depending on how the dye molecule is embedded a broad range of Π-system interactions occur. Optical band shifts as well as band shape changes and the formation of new bands are indicators for these molecular interactions [M.B. Grieve, A.J. Hudson, T. Richardson, Thin Solid Films, 1994, 243, 581.]. Among such interactions, exciton coupling and excimer formation are considered to be possible reasons for the observed major differences between spectra and kinetics of mono- and multilayer Langmuir–Blodgett films. Exciton coupling is indicated by red shifts of the Q-band of about 600 cm−1 in the absorption spectra of mono layer films. The observed broad red shifted fluorescence in the near-infrared region and their short lifetimes (≤ 100 ps) are assigned to excimer formation. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra of bilayer films as well as polarization dependencies of the Langmuir–Blodgett film absorption are presented."
"The layered perovskite-type niobate KCa2Nb3O10 and its derivatives show advantages in several fields, such as templated film growth and (photo)catalysis. Conventional synthesis routes generally yield crystal size smaller than 2 μm. We report a flux synthesis method to obtain KCa2Nb3O10 crystals with significantly larger sizes. By using different flux materials (K2SO4 and K2MoO4), crystals with average sizes of 8 and 20 μm, respectively, were obtained. The KCa2Nb3O10 crystals from K2SO4 and K2MoO4 assisted synthesis were protonated and exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets, and the optimal exfoliation conditions were determined. Using pulsed laser deposition, highly (001)-oriented piezoelectric stacks (SrRuO3/PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3/SrRuO3, SRO/PZT/SRO) were deposited onto Langmuir-Blodgett films of Ca2Nb3O10(-) (CNO) nanosheets with varying lateral nanosheet sizes on Si substrates. The resulting PZT thin films showed high crystallinity irrespective of nanosheet size. The small sized nanosheets yielded a high longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 100 pm/V, while the larger sized sheets had a d33 of 72 pm/V. An enhanced transverse piezoelectric coefficient d31 of -107 pm/V, an important input parameter for the actuation of active structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, was obtained for PZT films grown on CNO nanosheets with large lateral size, while the corresponding value on small sized sheets was -96 pm/V."
"SUMMARY The properties of monolayer films of organic materials are important for a variety of technologies. We have employed STM and AFM to study Langmuir‐Blodgett films of a variety of polymers on substrates of graphite, MoS 2 , and Au(111) on mica. The polymers were poly(octadecyl acrylate) (PODA), atactic and syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(2‐methyl‐1‐pentene sulphone) (PMPS). One striking feature was the degree of order observed; a second was the morphological difference between films of submonolayer thickness (long, thin fibrils) and those of at least monolayer thickness (lumpy structures arranged in domains). By pulsing the STM bias voltage to values in excess of 4V, we were able to bring about local modification of the polymer morphology."

"The steady-state current-voltage characteristics resulting from charge injection from a metal into an organic charge transporting polymer are found to deviate significantly from the space-charge-limited values when a Langmuir–Blodgett film of cadmium stearate is interposed between the metal and the organic polymer.

"We report the use of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) thin films as an optical gas sensor. The ZnPc thin films were fabricated by Langmuir-Blodgett technique onto quartz substrates. The responses of the thin films to various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were recorded by using optical absorption spectroscopy under static conditions. It was found that the thin films presented a reversible changes in the absorption spectra after exposure to the test gas. The strongest gas-sensing response was observed when the films were exposed to pyridine. The experimental results indicate that the phthalocyanine can easily react with the VOCs which include electron donating group or electron withdrawing group. And the responses are in good agreement with the intensity of electron donating or electron withdrawing ability."

"Abstract— Multilayer Langmuir‐Blodgett films of chlorophyll u and chlorophyll a in L‐α‐phosphatidylcholine dipal‐mitoyl matrix have been prepared. The films were protected by covering them with eight layers of stearic acid to ensure high film stability during the light illumination. Based on the time‐resolved fluorescence measurements a model with two types of chlorophyll arrangement was developed. One arrangement could be attributed to an aggregated state and the other to a homogeneously distributed state. Transient absorption in the wavelength range from 380 and 740 nm and the time range from 0.1 to 100 μ s were measured. The chlorophyll a radicals and the triplet state were observed and their lifetimes estimated."

"Four kinds of Langmuir-Blodgett assembled system are built up using stearic acid and bialkyne acid involving chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and ß-carotene. When the assemblies adsorb an electron acceptor, crystal violet, the fluorescence of the Chl-a monomer is quenched, but that of the Chl-a aggregate has no apparent attenuation. The investigation shows that this is caused by electron transfer quenching of excited Chl-a monomers in the assemblies. Energy transfer between Chl-a and crystal violet molecules does not seem to occur."

"Layers of poly(3-hexylthiophene), PHT, phenyl vinyl thiophene, PVT3, poly(p-phenylene-2,3′-bis(3,2′-diphenyl)-quinoxaline-7-7′-diyl), PPQ, and covalently linked porphyrin−fullerene donor−acceptor dyad, P−F, were deposited as various multilayer films, which then were used to study photoinduced electron transfer and photocurrent generation. The aim of the research was to clarify functioning of different energy and electron donating and accepting layers in charge transfer processes, which were initially created in a film consisting of parallel P−F molecules. The reactions were studied by means of time-correlated and steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved photovoltage, and electrochemical photocurrent measurements. The longest-lived charge-separated state and the highest efficiency of photocurrent generation were obtained for the multilayer structure of PHT|PVT3|porphyrin−fullerene. Porphyrin−fullerene dyads deposited parallel as the Langmuir –Blodgett film transfer electrons from porphyrin to fullerene yielding radical cation and anion moieties, respectively. The dyad on a PHT layer induces electron donation from PHT to the porphyrin cation. When PVT3 is deposited between the PHT and the P−F layers, it promotes both energy and electron transfer to the porphyrin moiety of the dyad, retards the recombination of the primary charge-separated state, and thus increases the photocurrent generation. PPQ was used as an electron acceptor from the fullerene radical anion, causing an increased lifetime of the charge separation."
"The title compound, C21H37NO2, is a new amphiphilic pyrrole with a long hydro­carbon chain, which will be used as a precursor for the synthesis of Langmuir–Blodgett films of porphyrins. Molecules related by an inversion centre are joined head-to-head into dimers by strong N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The dimers pack in the structure with their carbon chains parallel to one another, thereby forming alternating layers of carbon chains and pyrrole heads. The structure is further stabilized by two weak C—H⋯π intermolecular interactions, thereby saturating the hydrogen-bonding capability of the aromatic π-electron clouds."

"Because of the antioxidant activity of vitamin C (Vit C) polar heads, they can be used as a protective agent for fatty acids. Hence, the study on the growth of Vit C/stearic acid (SA) mixed binary films at air-water interface (known as Langmuir monolayer) and air-solid interface (known as Langmuir-Blodgett films) is of paramount interest. Although Vit C is situated at subsurface beneath SA molecules and interacts via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of Vit C and SA, several Vit C molecules may infiltrate within SA two-dimensional matrix at the air-water interface. The increased mole fraction of Vit C (0.125-0.5) and the reduction of temperature (from 22 to 10 °C) of the subphase water result in an increase in the amount of adsorbed Vit C at the air-water interface. The surface pressure (π)-area (A) isotherms illustrate that such inclusion of Vit C provokes a spreading out of Vit C/SA binary monolayers, which leads to an alteration of different physicochemical parameters such as elasticity, Gibbs free energy of mixing, enthalpy, entropy, interaction energy parameter, and activity coefficient. However, being polar in nature, the transfer of pure Vit C on substrates gets affected. It can be transferred onto substrate by mixing suitably with SA as confirmed by infrared spectra. Their structures, extracted X-ray reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy (topography and phase imaging) are found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate (hydrophilic and hydrophobic)."

"Algal polysaccharides may assist in the incorporation of metal ions from water and also have applications in health, interacting with biomembranes. In this paper, we have exploited the interactions at the molecular level of an extract of extracellular algal polysaccharide (EPS) with biomembrane models (lipid Langmuir monolayers). From surface pressure–area isotherms and Polarization Modulation Infrared Reflection–Absorption Spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), we have inferred that EPS interacts with both kinds of lipids: a negatively charged and a positively charged, however with different mechanisms of action. EPS, being negatively charged, interacts with the polar heads of the positively charged lipid monolayer, while for a negatively charged lipid forming the Langmuir film, EPS penetrates into the alkyl chains of lipid in a mechanism driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The insights obtained in this paper are relevant because these help to understand the action of EPS in biomembranes and enable future applications of EPS–lipid hybrid Langmuir–Blodgett films for heavy metal ion sensors. ► In this study we examined the interaction of algal polysaccharide (EPS) with lipid monolayers. ► We investigated the surface chemistry of mixed monolayers with surface pressure isotherm. ► We investigated the surface chemistry of mixed monolayers with infrared spectroscopy. ► We conclude that the interaction of EPS with monolayers depends on the charge of the lipid."
"We studied the adsorption of water soluble cyanine dyes (pseudoiso-cyanine and “stains-all”) to monomolecular layers of arachidic acid at the water-air interface in a Langmuir trough. Fluorescence microscopy was employed to on-line monitor the formation of J-aggregates upon adsorption. Large two-dimensional monodomain single crystals could be grown by this self-assembly process with optical properties reminiscent of those found and extensively studied for amphiphilic derivatives of the same chromophors [12]. In addition to the necessary Coulombic interaction between subphasedye and target monolayer, we found that details of the crystal morphology also crucially depend on substrate parameters, e.g., the packing density during adsorption. After transfer of the monolayer to a hydrophobic solid support, either as a Langmuir-Blodgett film or in a flow cuvette, i.e., still in contact with the aqueous phase, absorption spectroscopy as well as fluorescence spectroscopy and -microscopy was employed to characterize the adsorbate stability, its desorption, re-adsorption or exchange reactions."
"The fundamental properties of a gas-sensitive device for the recognition of odoriferous gases made of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film were studied. An SAW device can be operated at a higher oscillation frequency than a quartz oscillator, and an organic ultrathin film, such as the LB film, was used as the gas-sensitive film on the SAW device. The relationship between gassensitivity and the molecular orientation, as well as the thickness and the counterion of LB film, was investigated. The molecular orientation and the thickness of the LB films affected the gassensitivity. The gassensitivity of LB films incorporating counterions was largely dependent on the electronegativity of the counterion. The characteristics of the gas-sensitive device were elucidated and were utilized to realize the recognition system for odoriferous gases."

"Metal/Langmuir-Blodgett film/metal structures based on amphiphilic charge-transfer materials have been fabricated and the DC conductivity perpendicular to the plane of the film has been measured. Linear current-voltage behaviour was observed for small applied biases. In contrast, the high-field (>105 V cm-1) current against voltage characteristics exhibited a log (current) against voltage0.5 dependence, similar to that measured for fatty acid multilayers. No evidence for rectification has been found in structures containing both donor and acceptor materials. However, devices incorporating a tetracyanoquinodimethane derivative invariably possessed output voltages with no applied bias; a significant dispersion in the low-frequency capacitance was also noted for these structures."
"We applied time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) imaging under static conditions to investigate the interaction of electrons with a covalently bonded silane self-assembled layer of pentaflourphenyldimethylchlorosilane on Si and a physisorbed Langmuir–Blodgett film of a phospholipide dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine on Au. Well defined surface areas of the respective layer system were irradiated with electron beams of different energies (0.5–25 keV) and different fluences (up to 3×1014 electrons/cm2). The prebombarded surface areas were analyzed by imaging static SIMS, providing characteristic secondary ion intensities as a function of electron energies and fluences. From these results energy dependent electron induced damage cross sections σe(E) could be determined. We found a strong energy dependence of σe(E), very similar to that well known for electron induced secondary electron yields. For both investigated layers we found very similar damage cross sections σe of about 10−15 cm2 for 1 keV electrons. This is in contrast to the strong influence of the binding energy between the molecular overlayer and the substrate, on ion induced damage cross sections σi. Our results demonstrate the general capabilities of imaging static SIMS to investigate quantitatively damaging effects in molecular overlayers and surfaces."
"This paper presents methods of producing multilayered Langmuir-Blodgett films (L-B superlattices). A number of films was prepared, containing bilayers of 4-octadecylphenol (ODPh) and Ba behenate, VO- phthalocyanine and BA behenate, Chr. minutissimum reaction centers and arachidic acid, and stearatic acid and Cd (or Pb) sulfide. The degree of ordering of the structures obtained was studied by means of small-angle X-ray scattering. This method permits an estimation of the spacing of the L-B superlattices. The electron density profiles of L-B films consisting of biomolecular layers of Ba behenate and ODPh were calculated. The structural changes which occur in layers of the ODPh during the process of cross polymerization by electron irradiation and also in L-B films of Cd (Pb) stearate after exposure to an H2S atmosphere were also investigated."

"The measurement of in-plane birefringence ($\Delta{n}$) of ultrathin film is challenging due to a significant deviation of physical properties of materials in ultrathin regime as compared to that in bulk state. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon can be employed to measure change in refractive index of ultrathin film at a very high resolution. This article discusses simulation of SPR phenomenon in Kretschmann configuration for the measurement of $\Delta{n}$ in organic thin film exhibiting nematic-like ordering on the two dimensional gold surface. The distribution of plasmonic field on the gold surface was found to be anisotropic. This suggested that the coupling plasmonic field with that of organic thin film exhibiting nematic-like ordering on the gold surface will be non-isotropic. Therefore, a non-zero difference in resonance angle (RA) was obtained from SPR measurement performed along the optic-axis (OA) and orthogonal to OA of the in-plane nematic ordering ($\Delta\theta$). A calibration surface showing the variation of ($\Delta\theta$) as a function of $\Delta{n}$ and thickness of thin organic film consisting of shape anisotropic tilted molecules exhibiting nematic-like ordering on gold surface was obtained. This calibration surface was employed for the measurement of $\Delta{n}$ of single layer of Langmuir-Blodgett films of cadmium stearate (CdSA) and 4'-octyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (8CB) deposited on SPR chips. The thickness of the LB films was estimated using X-ray reflectivity measurement and $\Delta\theta$ was measured using a home built SPR instrument. The $\Delta{n}$ values were found to be 0.012 and 0.022 for ultrathin films of CdSA and 8CB molecules, respectively."
