"We prepared symmetric sandwich structures of the sequence gold/Langmuir–Blodgett film/gold by employing a novel evaporation technique. As molecular systems, we used an octasubstituted palladiumphthalocyanine and a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyldiimide derivative. Electronic transport measurements show a tunneling characteristic which arises from a direct tunneling process through molecular states. The current/voltage curves are symmetric for positive and negative bias proving the identical electronic behavior of the two organic/inorganic interfaces at the top and bottom electrode."
"Reproducible memory switching has been observed in metal/ Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film/metal sandwich structures: LB films consist of organic molecules such as dyes having a number of conjugated bonds. The device switches from a nonconducting off state to a conducting on state via an intermediate state, and it switches directly from the on to the off state within less than 10 ns upon the application of a voltage. Both off-state and on-state resistances of the device depend linearly on the number of monolayers, the conduction being predominantly through the LB films."
"The mechanism which gives rise to high electrical conductivity through a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film in a metal/LB film/metal sandwich has been studied. The systems investigated were Ag/ω-tricosenoic acid/Ag and Au-Pd/cadmium stearate/Au. Metallic pathways were found to exist through the LB films, even for relatively thick multilayers (N ≈ 40 layers). These are estimated to be about 6 × 10-3 μm2 in area. Switching effects were observed in these filaments on the application of voltage pulses. For the thickest LB films (about 100 layers) there is evidence that the conduction is predominantly through organic regions and is of the form log I ∝ V12."
"The spatial distribution of charges in ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films, with a monolayer thickness of 0.4 nm, deposited onto metals was determined by measuring the surface potential of the PI LB films as a function of the number of deposited layers. The depth of penetration of the excess charges displaced from metal electrodes into the PI LB films was about 3 nm. The saturated surface potential was an accurately linear function of the work function of the metal. We concluded that excess charges (mainly electrons) were transferred from metals into as-deposited PI LB films until thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the metal/PI interface by electron tunneling."
"Surface potentials of heat-treated polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films deposited on Au, Cr, and Al electrodes were measured in a dark vacuum vessel at various temperatures as a function of the number of deposited layers. The potential depended on the thickness of PI LB films and the work function of base metal electrode. The spatial charge distribution in PI LB films on various electrodes was determined from the relationship between the surface potential and the number of deposited layers. Based on this result, distribution of the density of electronic state in PI LB films was determined. It was experimentally shown that the electrostatic phenomena in PI LB films at the metal/film interface were explained taking account of surface states which exist within the range of ∼1 nm from the interface and molecular–ion states which exist in the entire range. Further, it was found that distribution of electronic density in states of polyimides was broadened with the increment of temperature."
"Surface potential of Cu-tetra-tert-butyl-phthalocyanine (CuttbPc) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films on metal electrodes were measured in a dark vacuum vessel at various temperatures as a function of the number of deposited layers. It was found that the potential built across CuttbPc LB film is a result of the displacement of electronic charges between metal electrodes and film. The spatial charge distribution in CuttbPc LB films was determined on the order of nanometer scale, and the distribution of the electronic density of states was also determined. Finally, we concluded that electrostatic phenomena occurring at the CuttbPc/metal interface is explained by assuming the presence of both electron donating and accepting states in CuttbPc LB films at the film/metal interface."
"New amphiphilic precursors of polyimide-isoindroquinazolinedione, polyamide-imide, polyimidazopyrrolone and polybenzoxadinone were synthesized. The monolayers of all the precursors on the water surface could be deposited onto various substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Subsequent thermal treatment of the built-up films under a nitrogen stream successfully produced the corresponding polymer films, which show high heat stabilities over 300–500°C and good insulating properties."
"A nanometer scale metal/Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film/metal structure is realized with an atomic force microscope combined with scanning tunneling microscope (AFM/STM). Even in this nanometer scale configuration, increase in conductance can be induced at any point in the LB film by application of a voltage pulse. The AFM/STM observation shows little surface modification has occurred by the voltage application, which shows that the conductance of the LB film changes without pit formation in the LB film or metal cluster deposition from the tip of the probe."
"The possibility to obtain surface layers on water and prepare solid multilayer Langmuir–Blodgett films of medium-density polyethylene is shown. The polymer film on water is stable, demonstrates a reversible surface pressure-area isotherm up to 15 mN/m, and can be deposited onto a substrate using the Langmuir–Blodgett technique in a wide range of surface pressures. The thickness of a single deposited layer is 5.1 nm on average. The dielectric and optical constants of multilayer films are near their bulk values. The films exhibit high dielectric strength of at least 200 MV/m."

"Surface potentials of heat-treated polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett (PI LB) films deposited on Au, Cr and Al electrodes were measured in a dark vacuum vessel at room temperature as a function of the number of deposited layers. The potential depended on the thickness of PI LB films and the work function of base electrode. The spatial charge distribution in PI LB films on various electrodes was determined from the relationship between the surface potential and the number of deposited layers. Based on this result, distribution of the density of electronic state in PI LB films was determined. It was experimentally shown that the electrostatic phenomena in PI LB films at the metal/film interface were explained with taking into consideration of surface states which exist within the range of ∼1 nm from the interface and molecular-ion states which exist in the entire range."
"The authors have examined the electrical properties of ultrathin insulating layers of polyimide (PI) deposited on a base of Au electrodes by using tunnel junctions with structures of Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) and Au/PI/Au. For Au/PI/Au junctions, ultrathin PI Langmuir-Blodgett films having good electrical insulating properties were obtained when the number of deposited layers was greater than about 30. It was found that the I-V characteristic of electrically insulating Au/PI/Au junctions was explained by a model on Simmons' tunnelling theory (1963), assuming that application of the top Au electrode resulted in a reduction of the PI layer thickness. For Au/Pi/(Pb-Bi) junctions, typical I-V characteristics of tunnel junctions were obtained at a temperature below the critical temperature of a superconducting Pb-Bi alloy, when the number of deposited layers was 27. It was concluded that the I-V characteristic was governed by the tunnelling conduction mechanism based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory."
"The current-voltage characteristic has been measured for a probe/Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film/metal structure with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The rapid increase of current and substantial increase in conductance have been found when a critical positive voltage was applied to the probe. A bright spot in the STM image has been observed at the position where the increase in the conductance occurred. The changes in the STM images are attributed to the change in the conductance of LB films themselves rather than the surface topography, and may be associated with the switching phenomena in LB films."
"The Kelvin method has been used to measure the relative surface potentials of multilayers of stearic acid deposited on n-type GaP. The potential varies with the number of layers deposited in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that the region explored consists of a Schottky exhaustion region."

"Surface potentials of heat-treated ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films and semiconducting phthalocyanine LB films deposited on Au, Cr and Al electrodes were measured by means of the Kelvin-probe method in a dark vacuum vessel at various temperatures as a function of the number of deposited layers. The spatial charge distribution in these LB films was determined on the order of nanometer scale from the relationship between the surface potential and the number of deposited layers. The distribution of the density of electronic surface states in these LB films was also determined. It was shown that the charge exchange phenomena at the metal/film interface are explained with taking into account the presence of the interfacial states within the range of about 1 nm from the metal/film interface. Finally we discuss the molecular-rectifying property of junctions using organic LB films sandwiched between Al and Au electrodes."
"Using thermally stable ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett films, we made tunnel junctions having structures of Nb/PI/(Pb–Bi) and Au/PI/(Pb–Bi). Then we examined the electrical transport properties of the junctions. Here, Nb and Pb-Bi are superconducting electrodes, and Au is a base-(noble metal) electrode. For Nb/PI/(Pb–Bi) junctions, it was found that an inherent oxide layer formed on a base-Nb electrode makes a significant contribution to the electrical conduction through the PI layer and that a typical current-voltage ( I - V ) characteristic based on the ideal Josephson junction was obtained even when the number of deposited PI layers was zero. For Au/PI/(Pb–Bi) junctions, typical I - V characteristics of tunnel junctions were obtained at a temperature below the critical temperature of a Pb–Bi superconducting alloy only when the number of deposited layers was 27."
"We have examined the electrical properties of ultrathin insulating layers of cadmium arachidate (C20), polyamic acid long alkyl amine salts (PAA) and polyimide (PI) by using tunnel junctions with structures of (Pb-Bi)/PAA (or C20)/(Pb-Bi), Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) and Au/PI/Au. Typical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of weakly coupled superconductors were obtained for (Pb-Bi)/PAA (or C20)/(Pb-Bi) junctions with one, two or three deposited layers at a temperature below the critical temperature of a Pb-Bi alloy. On the contrary, typical I-V characteristics of tunnel junctions were obtained for Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) and Au/PI/Au junctions, when the number of deposited layers is greater than about 30. Finally, we concluded that the efficiency of detecting microwaves is excellent in (Pb-Bi)/PAA (or C20)/(Pb-Bi) junctions, although bridging filaments exist in the PAA (or C20) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) layers, and that the PI LB layers become good electrical insulating spacers when the thickness of deposited layers is more than about 11 nm."
"Poly(fumarate) carrying bulky i-propyl substituents formed stable Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The Al/Al2O3/LB/Al metal-insulator-metal (MIM) cells exhibited non-linear J-V characteristics, and the MIM cells with more than 5 LB layers were utilizable as large-scale capacitors. However, the magnitude of current density and the capacitance of MIM cells were dependent on the preparation conditions and the atmospheric conditions of measurement. Further studies on ultrathin film preparation by the spin coating method were also reported."
"Molecular photodiodes possessing high efficiency for light–electricity conversion are constructed from polyimide Langmuir–Blodgett films consisting of electron acceptor, photo-sensitizer, and electron donor units."
"We fabricated Josephson junctions with the structure of Nb/Au/PI/(Pb-Bi) using an ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir- Blodgett film as an electrically insulating layer with neither the presence of native oxide layers formed on the base Nb layer nor the dissolution of the base-Nb/Au electrode during the imidization of PAA (Polyamic acid long alkylamine salts) films to produce PI LB films. A typical I - V characteristic of weakly-coupled Josephson junctions was found to be obtained."
"Nanometer scale recording bits were stably fabricated in polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films on atomically flat Au (111) surfaces using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The bits are written by voltage application through the AFM probe only until the conductance increases. This method eliminates the influence of the variation in the transition time and therefore the degradation of the tip of the probe. 1 Mbit stable writing can be realized. The overall error rate is less than 2×10−3. The results show that an AFM based memory system with PI LB films is a hopeful candidate to realize a scanning probe microscope based memory system."
"The capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films were examined with taking into account the interfacial electrostatic phenomena and the presence of the interfacial electric states at the metal/PI LB film interface. It was revealed that the apparent film thickness of metal/PI LB film/metal elements decreases due to the charge exchange at the metal/film interface. It was also shown that the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of Au/PI LB film/Al elements were ruled by the electric field of an order of 108–109 V/m built at the metal/film interface due to the excess charges transferred from metals into PI LB films."
"We demonstrate writing and reading bit arrays for information storage using an atomic force microscope with an electrically conducting probe and a medium consisting of a polyimide Langmuir–Blodgett film. In this system, data bits of 10 nm in diameter were written by application of voltage pulses with the conducting probe, and were read out by detecting the change in current. Topographical change was hardly observed at the data bits. A bit array of about 103 bits which contained information such as binary encoded characters was written and was successfully read out. The way to write and read the data bits with higher rate is discussed."

"The surface potential of polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films deposited on base-Au or -Cr electrodes was measured in a box shielded from light while nitrogen gas flowed through the box. Potential differences across PI LB films before and after heat treatment (at 100°C) were measured as a function of the number of deposited layers. The surface potential observed after the heat treatment was independent of the time elapsed. It was found that the surface potentials obtained after heat treatment depend on the base-electrode materials and the number of deposited layers, possibly due to the displacement of electrons from base-Au and -Cr electrodes into as-deposited PI multilayers. Finally, we concluded that photogenerated carriers in PI LB films were conveyed along the electric field established by the electrons displaced into as-deposited PI LB films from base-Au or Cr electrodes."

"The preparation of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films based on a photosensitive polyimide precursor 2 and their application to deep UV resists have been studied. LB films fabricated from a mixed monolayer of polyimide precursor 2-octadecyl alcohol-benzoin ethylether (molar ratio, 3:3:1) were found to act as negative working resists with a resolution of 0.5 μm space and 1.0 μm line, a sensitivity of 100 mJ cm-2 and good plasma etching resistance. They are promising for application as KrF and ArF excimer laser resists corresponding to 16 and 64 Mbit dynamic random access memories."
"The surface potential of multilayers of polyimide (PI) deposited on base-Au, Cr and Al electrodes was measured by the conventional surface potential technique. A comparison was made between the surface potential of clean base electrodes and that of base electrodes onto which various numbers of layers were deposited. The surface potential of PI depends strongly on the material of the base electrodes. It was suggested that the surface potential of PI multilayers originates from charges displaced from base electrodes to the PI multilayers."
"The electrical properties of metal insulator metal (MIM) junctions with an ultrathin polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film are examined at a temperature from 20 to 300 K. For Al/PI/Al junctions, native aluminum oxide makes a significant contribution to the electrical resistance of Al/PI/Al junctions with an electrical resistance as high as 10/sup 9/ Omega mm/sup 2/, even when the number of deposited layers is zero. For Au/PI/Au junctions, the I-V characteristic shows the existence of metallic pathways when the number of deposited layers n is <30, while the I-V characteristic shows the electrical conduction mechanism ruled by the tunneling theory when n is >or=30. From the experimental results, it is concluded that PI ultrathin LB films become good electrical insulating barriers when the deposited LB films have a thickness of more than 12 nm. Breakdown voltage of the PI layers sandwiched between both aluminum electrodes and gold electrodes are also investigated.< <ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">&gt;</ETX>"
"Structural analysis of the cross section of gold/Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) polymer film/gold sandwich structures was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the obtained results were complemented by electron transport investigations of the sandwich structures. The polymer film consisted of four to ten LB monolayers of a nonconducting polymer. TEM analysis of the sandwich cross section revealed a number of gold particles, 2–5 nm in size, formed during the fabrication process within the LB film close to the top electrode. Low temperature dc-transport measurements showed current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with equidistant steps that are not expected if the polymer film is thought to form a single laterally extended tunneling barrier between the metal electrodes. This feature can be understood, however, on the basis of the Coulomb blockade model applied to cluster-like metallic inclusions acting as an island separated from both Au electrodes by tunneling barriers."
"The dc conduction properties of Al/polyimide Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film/Al structure are reported. The current-voltage characteristics and the temperature dependence of the current are measured and compared with expectation from a tunneling theory, which takes natural oxide of aluminum into consideration. It is concluded that the conduction in the structure with five- or seven-layered LB film is predominantly by direct tunneling of electrons."
"Electrical properties of C n TCNQ Langmuir-Blodgett films sandwiched between aluminum electrodes are studied using thermally stimulated electrical measurements, and both the effect of film structure and the influence of native aluminum oxide are stressed. A change in induced charges on an electrode (Δ q 2 ) is measured while heating a sample. The relation between Δ q 2 and the number of deposited layers is in good agreement with a simple model based on a double-layered dielectric system. The direction of polarization in a film as deposited is also investigated using a photo-induced current measurement."
"We fabricated junctions with a single PORPI monolayer, where PORPI is a polymide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film containing a tetraphenylporphyrin (POR) moiety. We then investigated the electron transport properties of the junctions from current-voltage (I–V) and inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. PI LB films without POR were used as tunnelling barriers. Many peaks were seen in junctions with a PORPI monolayer at low voltages, due to the excitation of vibrational modes of the PORPI molecules, whereas no peak was observed in junctions without PORPI monolayers. One large peak was seen at a voltage around 1.9 V, due to the excitation of electron transitions in PORPI molecules, whereas negative electrical resistance was not observed."
"A soluble imidized polyimide containing pendant carboxylic groups was used to prepare Langmuir–Blodgett films. The soluble imidized polyimide was synthesized from 4,4′-(hexafluoro isopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) and 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABz) using a one-pot method. The carboxyl groups were reacted with octadecylamine (ODA) to form polymeric amphiphilic salt that was spread on the water surface and transferred to solid substrates to prepare the LB film. The ODA in the film was removed by thermal treatment, chemical treatment and dissolution. XPS, AFM, reflectance FT-IR and ellipsometry were used to characterize the films. The thermal and chemical treatments were more efficient than dissolution to remove ODA. The film had a smooth surface after thermal treatment."
"Electrical conduction through the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film in a metal/LB/metal structure has been studied. LB films of up to 40 layers in thickness have been shown to be shorted by metal filaments through the LB film. A switching effect has been observed when, by the application of a voltage pulse, the conduction through the filaments may be turned on or off. The present work examines the mechanism by which conducting paths are destroyed and reformed. DC measurements indicate this switching may be initiated by electromigration."
"Bits of 10 nm in diameter are written in polyimide Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films using the atomic force microscope (AFM) combined with scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for simultaneous operation (AFM/STM). Clear spots are observed in the current image at the points where voltage pulses are applied, while no specific feature such as protrusions or holes is observed in the AFM image. These results show that the bit cannot be attributed to metal deposition onto the sample surface or destruction of the LB film, but to the change in conductance of the LB film. The transition speed is faster than 10 μs, and reproducibility of the bit formation is so high that 103 bits, at least, can be formed without tip degradation. These facts show that the combination of LB film and AFM or STM is useful for storage devices with huge capacity."
"Abstract The synthesis and characterization of two new (TTF‐DNP‐CBPQT 4+ ) [2]rotaxanes 1 and 2 is reported, based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), 1,5‐dioxynaphthalene (DNP), and cyclobis(paraquat‐ p ‐phenylene) (CBPQT 4+ ) with cyclohexyl and alkyl chains as the spacers. Multilayer Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of [2]rotaxanes 1 and 2 are prepared. Conducting atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and two‐terminal junction device studies indicate that the LB films of [2]rotaxanes 1 and 2 show electrical bistability behavior. By comparing with the TTF‐DNP‐CBPQT 4+ [2]rotaxanes reported by Stoddart et al. previously, the present results imply that proper modification of the chemical structures of the TTF unit and the spacer have negligible effect on the electrical bistability behavior of these TTF‐DNP‐CBPQT 4+ [2]rotaxanes. These findings will allow for the design and preparation of new multifunctional TTF‐DNP‐CBPQT 4+ [2]rotaxanes in the future."
"Medium-density polyethylene (PE) thin films have been successfully prepared by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique. The absorbance obtained by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurement was proportional to the number of deposited layers, indicating that the layer-by-layer deposition of PE films proceeded successfully. Using the Kelvin probe surface potential measurement, it was concluded that as-deposited PE films were positively charged due to the displacement of electrons from the film to a metal. Finally, an energy diagram of the alkane oligomer molecule C30H62 was computed based on an ab initio molecular orbital calculation, and then the possibility of positive charging of the PE film was discussed."
"The interfacial electronic structure of π-conjugated Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films [octasubstituted palladiumphthalocyanine (PcPd) and preylene-tetra-carboxyldiimide derivative (PTCDI-Spent)] deposited on Au electrodes was examined by ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the results were compared with these obtained by the surface potential measurement in a dark vacuum vessel. As the number of deposited layers increases, the energy shift was observed in the UPS spectra, which were found to correspond well with the surface potential change. This result indicates that excess electronic charges are transferred from LB-films to the Au electrodes until a thermodynamic equilibrium is established at the metal-film interface, resulting in the formation of an electrostatic double layer within the range of 1 to 2 nanometers in thickness. The contribution of layers sandwiched between the metal and the PcPd molecular film to the UPS spectra was also examined."
"The temperature dependence has been investigated for the photoinduced birefringence in Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films from the azocopolymer 4-[N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)]amino-2′-chloro-4′-nitroazobenzene (MMA-DR13) mixed with cadmium stearate. The build-up and relaxation of the birefringence in the range from 20 to 296 K were fitted with a Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) function, with a β-value of 0.78–0.98 for the build-up and 0.18–0.27 for the decay. This is consistent with a distribution of time constants for the kinetics of the birefringence processes. The maximum birefringence increased with increasing temperature up to 120 K because the free volume fluctuation also increased with temperature. Above 120 K, the birefringence decreased with temperature as thermal diffusion dominates. In the latter range of temperature, an Arrhenius behavior is inferred for both build-up and decay of birefringence. In each case two activation energies were obtained: 0.8 and 5 kJ/mol for the build-up and 10 and 30 kJ/mol for the decay. The energies for the build-up are much lower than those associated with motion of the polymer chain, which means that the dynamics is governed by the orientation of the chromophores. For the decay, local motion of lateral groups of the polymer chains becomes important as the activation energies are within the range of γ-relaxation energies."
"Monolayers and multilayers of polycyanoacrylate derivatives have been studied. Cyanoacrylates containing from two to ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain have been used (C2–C10 cyanoacrylates). Cyanoacrylates with more than 5 carbon atoms in the chain are shown to be stable at the air-water interface and can be transferred on to a solid substrate. LB films consisting of 10–100 monolayers have been formed from C6–C10 polycyanoacrylates. A novel negative type UV resist based on LB films has been produced from the heptylpolycyanoacrylate, which possesses a sensitivity of 0.5 J cm−2. A resolution of 0.3 μm was achieved using this resist. Plasma-resistant high resolution electron beam resists have also been obtained with a sensitivity of 5 × 10−5 C cm−2 for C7 cyanoacrylate LB films and 2 × 10−7 C cm−2 for a cyanoacrylate containing a non-saturated link in the ω-position of the hydrocarbon chain."
"This paper presents a new method for the calculation of the tunnel current through a metal/multilayer of conjugated molecules/metal sandwich structure under low and moderate electric fields. The electron transfer from one electrode to the other through the cascaded molecules is treated step by step by considering hopping integrals between neighboring molecules. A rather simple computer calculation gives access to the tunnel current. A second approach is also given which consists in approximating the cascaded tunnel mechanism by a homogeneous rectangular insulating barrier, the height of which can be calculated simply from the basic parameters of the system. These two calculation methods have been applied to a practical system: Langmuir–Blodgett films made of a two-dimensional porphyrin polymer. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in tetrapyridino–porphyrin bromide, which is the monomeric unit of the polymer, has been calculated and found at 2.8 eV below vacuum level. From this value and literature values for the other parameters, the tunnel current densities vs voltage have been calculated for various film thicknesses (2–5 monomolecular layers). The two calculation methods give quite close values for the tunnel current densities. The tetrapyridinoporphyrin polymeric Langmuir–Blodgett film is suggested to check the model experimentally, because once fabricated, the rigid polymeric film cannot undergo molecular reorganisation or evaporation and hence should contain few pinholes."
"We examined the photoresponse of the surface potential across polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films deposited on base-Au electrodes, and then analyzed the surface potential change initiated with photoirradiation by assuming a model based on the three-step process of photoconductivity in polymers. In the model, photogeneration of carriers is of the Onsager type, where a space charge field formed at the PI/base-Au electrode interface makes a significant contribution to the photogeneration, and the succeeding carrier transport does not suffer from bimolecular recombination."
"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films from diazobenzene Sudan III have been investigated using surface potential measurements as a function of number of layers and deposition pressures, with the surface potential data being related to molecular dipole moments obtained from theoretical electronic structure calculations. The surface potential increased with the number of layers for SIII LB films, and then tended to saturate. Results from density functional theory (DFT) and UV-vis spectroscopy indicated that the increase is due to addition of layers with oriented molecular dipoles, with the saturation tendency being attributed to a decrease in the amount of material deposited in each layer. The surface potential increased with the surface pressure used for deposition, probably owing to a higher contribution from the vertical component of the dipole moment as a closer molecular packing, which is associated with decreasing conformational entropy, was reached."
"Surface potentials of phthalocyanine derivative Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films on metal electrodes were studied. Two kinds of phthalocyanine derivatives (C6PcCu and CuttbPc) were examined as a function of the number of deposited layers. The distributions of spatial excess charge density and electronic density of states at the metal/film interface were determined. The difference in the electrostatic phenomena observed in these two phthalocyanine LB films was attributed to the difference in the density of surface states of these two films."
"Symmetrically contacted sandwich junctions incorporating very thin Langmuir-Blodgett films of perylenetetracarboxyldiimide and octasubstituted phthalocyanine derivatives have been prepared. At 4.2 K current/voltage curves display abrupt current increases at reproducible voltage thresholds. To estimate the ionization potential of these π-systems, cyclic voltammetry studies were conducted on the molecules in a nonpolar solvent. The ionization potential of the phthalocyanine compound is directly accessible through its oxidation potential. In the case of the perylenetetracarboxyldiimide derivatives, the ionization potential is approximated by using the electron affinity (obtained from the reduction potential) and the ‘HOMO-LUMO’ gap from absorption spectra. The obtained values are close to the measured voltage thresholds and emphasize the picture of HOMO-mediated tunneling processes."
"Surface potentials of Cu tetra-tert-butyl-phthalocyanine (CuttbPc) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films on metal electrodes were measured under photoillumination. The surface potential of CuttbPc LB films on Au electrode, positively charged as deposited, decreases by photoillumination, whereas the potential of films on Al and Cr electrodes, negatively charged as deposited, increases. A linear relationship was obtained between the work function of metal electrodes and the saturated surface potential of CuttbPc LB films in the dark, and a similar relationship was also suggested under photoillumination. These results indicate that electronic charges are exchanged at the interface between metal electrodes and the films until the surface Fermi level of films and the Fermi level of metals mutually coincide. The space charge distribution in CuttbPc LB films was determined on the order of nanometer film thickness, and the distribution of the electronic density of states was also determined assuming the presence of both electron donor and acceptor states at the film/metal interface. It was concluded that about 1% of CuttbPc molecules contribute the charge exchange and 9–27% of these contributed charges lose the charge exchange by photoillumination. Finally, the surface potential decay process was analyzed assuming thermodynamics quasi-equilibrium at the interface."
"We have investigated the relationship between the switching phenomena and H-like aggregates in squarylium-dye Langmuir-Blodgett (SQ LB) films. The current-voltage characteristics of SQ LB films sandwiched between the top gold electrode and the bottom aluminum electrode indicated conductance switching phenomena below the temperature of 100°C but not at 140°C. Current densities suddenly increased at switching voltages between 2 and 4 V. The switching voltage increased as the temperature increased between room temperature and 100°C. Current densities were 50–100 µA/cm2 in a low-impedance state (ON state). A high-impedance state (OFF state) can be recovered by applying a reverse bias, and therefore, these bistable devices are ideal for memory applications. The dependence of conductance switching phenomena and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra on annealing temperatures was studied. The results revealed that conductance switching phenomena were caused by the presence of H-like aggregates in the SQ LB films."
"Thermally stable and photosensitive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films have been developed from polyamic acid (PA) and 4-(17-octadecenyl)pyridine (ODP). Fine patterns are easily fabricated with these LB films. From experiments using model compounds it has been found that the double bond in ODP is necessary for a cross- linking reaction to occur. The normalized thickness saturates around 40% for LB films irradiated in air or under flowing nitrogen conditions. It also saturates around 40% for LB films with higher molecular weight PA. By Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements it has been found that this saturation is not due to a side reaction of the photosensitive agent nor is it due to main chain polymer degradation. It may be due to a scission between the main chain and the side-chain which contains the photosensitive group. Although the sensitivity has not been improved by using a high molecular weight polymer, it has been found that higher molecular weight polymers have the advantage of uniformity of the film after imidization."
"The surface potential of heat-treated polymide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films deposited on various metalelectrodes was measured in a box shielded from light while nitrogen gas flowed through the box. The surface potential depended on base electrode material and the number of deposited layers. The surface potential saturated when the number of deposited PI LB layers was about 10. The saturated surface potential was a linear function of the work function of the metal. It was suggested that excess charges (electrons) were transferred from metal electrodes to heat-treated PI LB films until thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the metal-PI interface. The penetration depth of excess charges displaced from the metal electrodes into PI LB films was estimated to be about 4nm. In order to clarify further the formation of a space charge layer in PI LB films at the metal-PI interface, the photoinduced surface potential in heat-treated PI was also measured. It was found that the surface potential changes as a result of the displacement of photogenerated carriers along the electric field produced by excess charges."
"Surface potential of heat-treated polyimide (PI) LB films deposited on various metal electrodes was measured in a box shielded from light while nitrogen gas flowed through the box. The surface potential dependend on base-electrode materials and the number of deposited layers. The surface potential saturated when the number of deposited layers was several tens. The saturated surface potential was a linear function of the work function of metals. It was suggested that excess charges were transferred from metal-electrodes into PI LB films until the thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the metal/PI LB film interface. Spatial charge and electric field distributions in PI LB films were also estimated from the surface potential measurement. It was found that an electric field on the order of 108 V/m was established at the metal/PI LB film interface. The surface potential of PI LB films on Au epitaxially grown electrodes changed somewhat steeply in comparison with that on Au evaporated electrodes with the increment of the number of deposited layers."
"We investigated the Maxwell displacement current generated across one-layer polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films with azobenzene by photoirradiation. Transient displacement-current pulses were found to be produced in precursor films of PI (AZBPAA), because successive isomerizations were induced in the films by irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light. In contrast, the displacement current was not generated in PI LB films containing azobenzene (AZBPI) by the photoirradiation, because the photoisomerization was not initiated in AZBPI LB films and the displacement current generation due to the transportation of photoexcited electrons in the films was negligibly small. The displacement current due to the photoexcited electron transfer between AZBPAA single monolayers and electrodes was found to be created only in the initial photoirradiation with visible light, and the photoexcited electron transfer was found to be eliminated by introducing a polyisobutyl-methacrylate LB film between AZBPAA single monolayers and electrodes. Finally, we concluded that motion of charged particles can be purposefully controlled and be detected by the displacement current measurement."
"The formation of well-ordered Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of a peripherally octa(pentyloxy)-substituted palladium phthalocyanine is reported. Stacking interactions of the ring systems in the LB film are revealed by the UV-Vis spectrum. A layer separation of 21.3 Å is found by small angle X-ray diffraction and is compatible with the assumption of phthalocyanine rings in an edge-on configuration, nearly perpendicular to the substrate plane. The most impressive demonstration of the high order in these LB films is the successful preparation of (gold/phthalocyanine LB film/gold) sandwich structures with LB film thicknesses down to ten monolayers, resulting in symmetrical current/voltage curves."

"The photoinduced displacement current across polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films incorporated in Au/PI/air-gap/Au structures was investigated without the application of an external electric field. Transient displacement current was found to be produced by photoirradiation with a wavelength of 400 nm, because carriers were generated in PI LB films and were then conveyed along the electric field established in a Schottky depletion region in the PI LB films."
"The current–voltage characteristics of sandwich devices with the structure of top gold electrode/squarylium-dye Langmuir-Blodgett (SQ LB) films/bottom aluminum electrode indicated four kinds of conductivity depending on the evaporation conditions of the top gold electrode. The current densities of two, which showed conductance switching, of the four samples were 30–40 µA/cm2 and 20–30 mA/cm2 in the ON state. In the former case, the dependence of conductance switching voltage on the number of SQ LB films and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were studied. The results revealed that conductance switching phenomena were induced at the interface between the top gold electrode and SQ LB films, and caused by the presence of H-like aggregates in SQ LB films."
"The capacitance–voltage ( C – V ) characteristics of ultrathin phthalocyanine (CuttbPc) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were examined, taking into account the interfacial electrostatic phenomena. It was revealed that the electrical properties of CuttbPc LB film sandwiched between metal electrodes were dominated by negatively charged space-charge layers with a thickness of less than 10 nm. It was also shown that the density of charges in the electrostatic double layer of Al/CuttbPc LB film, determined from a low-frequency C – V measurement, is in good agreement with the space-charge density, obtained by the conventional surface- potential measurement."
"Abstract Polyimide Langmuir‐Blodgett (LB) films were prepared with a Pyromellitic dianhydride‐4, 4′ oxydianiline precursor, and the properties of the polyamic acid salt monolayer characterized by different methods. The π‐A relationship revealed that the precursor monolayer exhibits anisotropy on the water surface, the Wilhelmy plate being more sensitive to pressure when it is perpendicular to the compression direction. FTIR results showed that polyamic acid salt LB films have lower imidization energy than the corresponding painting films and can be imidized at lower temperature. The molecular arrangement in the LB films was studied by X‐ray diffraction and polarized FTIR, showing that the polyamic acid salt LB film is of Y‐type, in which the molecules are highly oriented, with the main chain lying parallel to the substrate and the long fatty acid chains stretching out at a certain angle. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry"
"The current–voltage ( I – V ) characteristics of Au electrode (M)–polyimide (PI) Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film (I)–Al electrode (M)-MIM element are analyzed, taking into account the interfacial electrostatic phenomena and the presence of the interfacial electronic states. On the basis of the Richardson–Schottky model, the attractive force and potential energy created by a series of mirror image charges against both electrodes are calculated. A positive bias ( V ex &gt;0) applied to an Au–PI LB film–Al element gives rise to the injection of electrons from the Au electrode into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of PI LB film, whereas a negative bias ( V ex &lt;0) causes the injection from Al electrode. The potential distributions across the PI LB film and the potential barrier height under the condition of various externally applied voltages ( V ex ) are calculated, assuming the presence of surface states at the metal/film interface. It is determined that the calculation results of the I – V characteristics can predict the experimental results."
"Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) from LB films of phthalocyanine derivative deposited on metal (aluminum: Al) and glass substrate has been investigated. In spite of the existence of the inversion center, for both Al and glass substrates, the bulk characteristic of the SHG was confirmed by the thickness dependence of the SH intensity. Drastic enhancement of the signal intensity for Pc/Al sample was also observed. In order to clarify the enhancement mechanism, the thickness-dependent SH intensity was calculated in terms of the quadrupole mechanism. As a result, it is possible that the Al layer enhances the SHG due to the quadrupole process."
"Molecular orientation in Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films of poly(diisopropyl fumarate) (PDiPF) and poly(isopropyl N-isopropyl fumaramate) (PiPFAE), prepared by solution polymerization and emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization, respectively, was investigated. The π–A isotherms of both polymers indicated formation of stable Langmuir monolayers. The refractive index measurements as well as the polarized IR and UV spectroscopy of the LB films revealed that the backbones of the polymers were oriented parallel to the dipping direction of the substrate. The LB films were applied to a nematic liquid crystal alignment film, and the relationship between optical axes of the LB films and the alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules was characterized. Utilization of PDiPF and PiPFAE as a matrix polymer for polymer dispersed liquid crystals was also examined, and a higher performance with a better contrast ratio was obtained for PiPFAE."

"The surface potentials across multilayer films with polar molecules were calculated assuming that the constituent molecules are rod-like and orientationally distributed. In the calculation, the internal electric field was taken into consideration. The effect of the excess charges displaced from the base metal electrodes was also taken into consideration. It was found that the excess charges displaced from base metal electrodes contribute to the change in orientation of polar molecules which results in a change in the voltage across the monolayers. The experimental results for precursor films of polyimide with polar groups (–OCF 3 , –OCH 3 ) are discussed based on the analysis developed here."
"The surface potential of polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films on various metal electrodes was examined, and then the spatial distribution of charges in the films was determined. It was found that excess electrons are displaced from electrodes into the films until thermodynamic equilibrium is established at the film/metal interface. The electron transport mechanism through PI LB films sandwiched between noble metal and superconducting electrodes was also examined by means of I-V and d2V/dI2-V measurements. It was concluded that electrons tunnel through PI LB films without loss of energy and that PI LB films can be used as tunnel barriers in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements."
"We have fabricated Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of a poly-diisopropyl fumarate (PDiPF) for nematic liquid crystal alignment and have characterized their alignment capability using a nematic liquid crystal of pentyl-cyano biphenyl (5CB). We prove that the PDiPF-LB films can be obtained by simple processes compared with polyimide-LB films. We present deposition conditions of the PDiPF-LB films, and the relationship between optical axes of the PDiPF-LB films and the alignment direction of 5CB on the films."
"Surface potential built at the interface between two kinds of heat-treated polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films (denoted as PI and TRIPI) was measured in a box shielded from light while nitrogen gas was flowing through the box. The surface potential depended on the number of deposited layers, and the surface potential saturated when there are several deposited layers. The polarity of the potential across the PI/TRIPI LB film interface suggests that excess charges (electron) were transferred from TRIPI into PI. It was found that space charges were distributed in both PI and TRIPI LB films within the range of several nanometers from the PI/TRIPI interface. Surface potential of PI deposited on semiconducting materials used in power cable engineering was also examined. The potential depended on the semiconducting material and on the number of deposited layers of PI. The difference in the saturated potential across PI and semiconducting material coincided well with the difference in the fermi level of these materials, indicating that excess charges were transferred until thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the interface between PI and the semiconducting materials. The electric field of the order of 108 V/m was formed at the interface."
"We fabricated Au/PI/Al junctions and then examined the charge storage phenomena in polyimide (PI) layers. We also examined the current-voltage ( I-V ) characteristics of the junctions in connection with charge storage phenomena. It was found that numerous excess charges were injected into PI multilayers from electrodes by the application of biasing voltages. Therefore, the space charge field formed in as-deposited PI layers was distorted by the excess charges injected. It was also found that asymmetric I-V characteristics observed for Au/PI/Al junctions depended on the biasing voltages, because the space charge field formed in PI layers influenced the I-V characteristics."

"We fabricated Al/Al 2 O 3 /polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett films (PI LB)/Al (MIM) and Al/Al 2 O 3 /PI LB/Al/Al 2 O 3 /PI LB/Al (MIMIM) junctions by means of the LB technique, and then examined the electrical transport properties of the junctions from the tan δ values of these junctions. For MIM junctions, the tunneling conduction mechanism dominated in PI LB films when the number of deposited PI LB films was less than 4. In contrast, the bulk conduction mechanism dominated when the number of deposited PI LB films was greater than 5. For MIMIM junctions, the tan δ value of the junctions was about 10% of that of MIM-external wire-MIM junctions. It was concluded that middle Al/Al 2 O 3 layers sandwiched between top Al and base Al electrodes control the number of electrons passing through MIMIM junctions."

"Surface potentials in two kinds of polyimide (PI and TRIPI) Langmuir-Blodgett films on various metal electrodes were examined before and after photoirradiation. Linear relationships between the saturated surface potential and the work function of metals were obtained before photoirradiation, suggesting that excess charges were transferred from metals into heat-treated PI LB films until thermodynamic equilibrium was attained at the interface. The heat-treated PI LB films were charged positively with photoirradiation, whereas the heat-treated TRIPI LB films were charged negatively. It was found that the linear relationships between the saturated surface potential and the work function of metals were again obtained after photoirradiation."
"We have performed measurements of the dark conductivity and photoconductivity on organic tunnel junctions. The junctions incorporate only a few monolayers of two different organic substances, transferred to the substrate by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Current/voltage measurements at liquid helium temperature reveal a rectifying behavior which is manifested in characteristic onsets in current, arising from resonant tunneling processes through molecular states. To emphasize that the observed effects are actually originating from the molecules, we record the photoaction spectra of the tunnel junctions and compare the results with absorption spectra measured on identical organic structures without the presence of electrodes. The photoaction spectra and the absorption spectra show characteristic bands at the same wavelengths. From this result we conclude that both organic layers in the tunnel junction are intact. Therefore, the application of electrodes affects only a small number of the outer monolayers of the organic film and does not destroy the heterostructure itself."

"Aluminum, arachidic acid (C 20 ) multilayered and/or 2-dodecyl-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (C 12 TCNQ) multilayered Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, and aluminum were deposited successively on a substrate. The electric conductance in the interface direction of the upper-Al/C 12 TCNQ/C 20 /under-Al structure, upper-Al/C 20 /C 12 TCNQ structure, and other control structures was measured using the four-point probe method. The electric conductance in the interface direction of only the upper-Al/C 12 TCNQ/C 20 /under-Al structure with the number of deposited LB layers between 3 and 5 was 10 or 100 times larger than that of the control structures, including aluminum thin films."
"We fabricated cells having the structure of Au/LB/air-gap/Au in order to eliminate the influence of both the inherent oxide layer formed on electrodes and metallic wires through the LB film. We then investigated the dynamic behavior of constituent molecules in the LB film by measuring the thermally stimulated current (TSC) in a short-circuit condition while the cell was heated at a constant heating rate. TSC peaks were observed at temperatures of -190°C, -40°C and about 90°C, and these peaks were assigned to the relevant discharge mechanism relating to the thermal relaxation of molecules in the LB film. Finally, it was concluded that TSC peaks were obtained even when the number of deposited layers was one."
"The surface morphology of UV-light polymerized monolayer Langmuir–Blodgett films of 10-12 pentacosadyinoic acid (12-8 diacetylene) deposited on flat gold substrates was imaged by atomic force microscopy. Current–voltage characteristics of the monolayer film was measured by using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at individual points on the film surface and compared to the ones measured on the bare gold substrate. The measured current–voltage characteristics are correlated and discussed with the expectation of the Au Fermi level of the substrate, Pt/Ir Fermi level of the tip and the higher occupied molecular orbital/lower unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the polydiacetylene molecule."
"Abstract Photopolymerization of cadmium 10,12‐pentacosadiynoate (CdDA) in Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films, with the molecular packing well arranged by moderate preannealing, was investigated with near‐edge X‐ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Greenish films of polydiacetylene with an absorption wavelength of 705 nm were obtained through the photopolymerization of preannealed monomer LB films, and this resulted in an extended π‐conjugate system based on the well‐ordered monomer in a two‐dimensional arrangement. The electronic structures of the polydiacetylenes were found to be correlated to the variation of the molecular arrangements in the films from the changes in the NEXAFS spectra through photopolymerization in the LB films. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Amphiphilic ruthenium bipyridine complexes based on 1,3,4-oxadiazole-pyridine ligands (L1, L2) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, UV–Vis spectroscopy, electrochemistry and UV–Vis spectroelectrochemistry. The free ligands and the respective ruthenium(II) complexes exhibit an intraligand π−π∗ absorption band in the UV region that overlaps with the MLCT bands. The [Ru(bpy)2(L2)](PF6)2 complex with a bidentated L2 ligand did not form a stable monolayer in water-air interface demonstrating the relevance of coordination geometry on the molecular packing properties. In contrast, stable Langmuir-Blodgett films of the [Ru(bpy)2(L1)Cl]PF6 complex (RuL1) exhibiting reversible and fast spectroelectrochemical properties associated with the Ru(III/II) redox couple were obtained, where redox site inactivation become relevant above 20 monolayers where the current leveled up. Thin LB films were deposited on poly(bithiophene) to enhance its photoelectrochemical properties and realize photoresponsive AND and OR logic gate devices."

"The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of mixed LB films of a conjugated dimer-type Cu-porphyrin and cadmium arachidate show a drastic change by adding a small amount of n-hexatriacontane as trigger molecules that cause a distinct change of orientation of porphyrins. Similar phenomenon has been observed in monomer-type Cu-porphyrin LB films. The marked difference between these cases is that the dimer films show a septet Cu hyperfine structure instead of a quartet of the monomer films with the total spectral span unchanged. This results from the Heisenberg spin exchange interaction between two Cu spins in a dimer, providing direct evidence for the existence of the dimer in LB films. The line-shape analysis of the ESR spectra observed at the X and K bands yields the detailed molecular orientation. The dimer plane is slightly more inclined toward the film plane compared with monomers in the presence of n-hexatriacontane."
"Abstract In the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of arachidic acid (AA) mixed with amphiphilic ammonium ions or an amphiphilic amine, AA was mixed with the second component at the molecular level and formed salt when the fraction of AA was not larger than 0.5. Further the fraction of the second component in the mixed LB films was smaller than that in the spreading solution with the fraction of the second component larger than 0.5."
"We have investigated the thermal behavior of H-aggregate in a mixed Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) film of the merocyanine dye (MS18)-arachidic acid (C20)-n-octadecane (AL18) ternary system by means of UV−visible and IR absorption spectroscopy in the range from 25 to 250 °C with a continuous scan. The results of both UV−visible and IR spectra indicate that the temperature-dependent variation in MS18 aggregation state is linked not only with the degree of intramolecular charge transfer and the behavior of packing, orientation, conformation, and thermal mobility of the MS18 hydrocarbon chain but also with the presence and absence of AL18. The H-aggregate dissociates from 25 up to 50 °C, which is caused by the AL18 evaporation from the mixed LB film and the increment of thermal mobility of the MS18 hydrocarbon chain. From 110 to 160 °C, blue-shifted bands, attributed to the oligomeric MS18 aggregation, appear near 515 nm in the MS18-C20-AL18 ternary system as well. The temperature at which the 515 nm band occurs is identical for both present ternary system and previously investigated MS18-deuterated arachidic acid (C20-d) binary system, and it is in good agreement with the melting point (110 °C) of cadmium arachidate (CdC20). Therefore, it is indicated that the driving force which induces the 515 nm band comes from the melting phenomenon of CdC20 molecules which are phase-separated from MS18 molecules in as-deposited LB films."
"Abstract Phenylcyclohexyl group, a mesogenic unit, was introduced into the hydrophobic part of the amphiphilic cyanine and squarylium dyes. Surface pressure-area isotherms were explained in terms of the bulkiness and the stronger dispersion force of the mesogenic unit. In-plane anisotropy was observed for mixed LB films of the amphiphilic cyanine dye containing the mesogenic unit."
"The stability and reproducibility of the electrical resistance measured on a thin Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of a copper tetraoctadecyltetrapyridino [3,4-b : 3´,4´-g : 3´´,4´´-l : 3´´´,4´´´-q] porphyrazinium bromide (CuS18) were improved with the control of the organic/inorganic interface between the film and the substrate. Homogenization of the physical surface properties both of the gold electrodes and of the glass substrate was obtained through grafting self-assembled monolayers onto both types of surfaces. Such a strategy allowed fabrication of samples with reproducible resistance values due to a better quality of the LB transfer of the organic monolayer onto the substrate. However, electrical drift with the elapsed time was still observed (a factor of 103 in 3 months). This ageing behaviour of the electrical resistance appeared closely related to the instability of the gold clusters located at the border of the electrodes. Their immobilization obtained with the treatment of the substrate with a thiolsiloxane resulted in a much slower and reproducible electrical drift."
"Abstract A vertical dipping method is normally employed to prepare polyimide (PI) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films for liquid crystal (LC) alignment due to its dipping effects. In this paper, however, we exploited a horizontal method to make PI LB alignment layers on a novel Langmuir trough using a flowing subphase. The surface morphology of PI LB film deposited on a graphite substrate was studied by atomic force microscopy. Experimental results give evidences that the polymer chains are oriented in the flow direction, along which LC molecules are aligned homogeneously. Thus the alignment of LCs may act through the orientation of PI molecules."
"Abstract An imidazole-containing amphiphilic polymer (IMA-OVE) was synthesized and the metal-complexing capability of its monolayer at the air-water interface was examined. The polymer was obtained by radical copolymerization of N-(2-(4-imidazolyl)ethyl)maleamic acid (IMA) with n-octadecyl vinyl ether (OVE). Monolayers of IMA-OVE on aq. subphases containing metal ions were studied by measuring surface pressure-area isotherms. The preparation conditions of IMA-OVE Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films on fluorocarbon membranes and calcium fluoride plates were studied and the physicochemical properties of the LB films were then examined by Raman, XPS, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The concentration of metal ions incorporated into the LB films was the order of Fe3+> Mg2+>Cu2+>K+."
"Abstract The pyrolyzed polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett film can provide an aligning layer and an electrode for liquid crystal cells. The LB film surface is characterized by Scanning electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and optical absorption spectra. We find that the aligning and conducting mechanism is due to the presence of carbon enriched islands in the LB film. The electrooptical effects in twisted nematic liquid crystal cells using the films as electrodes and aligning layers are observed."
"Abstract Electrical properties and thermal annealing effects of C22-quinoliuni(TCNQ) Langmuir-Blodgett(LB) films were studied. Typical current-voltage(I-V) characteristics along the perpendicular direction show an anomalous behavior of breakdown near the electric-field strength of 106 V/cm. From the study of I-V characteristics in the high-electric field region, it is found that there is a contribution of joule heating in addition to the electrical effect. To see the thermal influence of the specimen, current was measured as a function of temperature(20 ∼ 180°C). It shows that the current increases about 4 orders of magnitude near 60 ∼ 70°C, and remains constant for a while up to ∼ 150 °C and then suddenly drops. Such increase of current near 60 ∼ 70 °Cseems to be related to a softness of alkyl chains. Besides the electrical measurements, UV/visible absorption(300 ∼ 800nm) of the thermally annealed sample was measured to see the internal-structure change. It is found there are four characteristic peaks. At 494nm, the optical absorption of the thermally annealed specimen at 60°C starts to increase and stays almost constant upto ∼ 140°C. And eventually it disappears above 180°C."
"Long-chained amphiphiles containing a sulfonyl group accompanied by azobenzene moieties and heterocyclic rings (thiazolyl or pyrimidinyl) were obtained. It was found that the derivatives of sulfathiazole (I and III) were more effective in monolayer formation as compared with sulfadiazine ones (II and IV) and their π–σ isotherms were characterized by a high collapse pressure, at σ reaching 0.24–0.25 nm2. The transfer ratio of the monolayer onto silver-coated glass slides was in the range 0.95–0.98. The average thickness of the monolayer transferred onto the slides (determined by surface plasmon resonance) amounted to 3.05–3.25 nm, depending on the length of the amphiphile hydrophobic chain. The amphiphiles in question, with a donor-acceptor molecular structure separated by π-electron system, showed nonlinear optical properties with the first hyperpolarizability values being 3.6–3.8 times that of p-nitroaniline."
"A hybrid four layer guide (FLG) including a glass guide and a 2-docosylamino-5-nitropyridine Langmuir–Blodgett film is described, and some tests are reported on an electro-optic modulator based on this FLG. The modulation of laser diode light was obtained by guided mode interference, without a Mach–Zehnder configuration of the device. From the modulated signal the r22 electro-optic coefficient was calculated as 11 pm/V."

"Second-harmonic generation was used in an investigation of the quadratic optical susceptibilities and of the structure of Langmuir — Blodgett films of a number of azobenzene derivatives. The angular distribution of second-harmonic radiation could differ significantly for films containing domains with the average size r considerably less than the second-harmonic wavelength λ and films consisting of relatively large domains (r ≫ λ). The orientation of the molecules relative to the substrate was determined in both cases."
"New bisaxially coordinated phthalocyaninatoiron complexes were synthesized by melting azopyridines and phthalocyaninatoiron. Monolayers of azopyridine/phthalocyaninatoiron complexes were spread from their benzene solutions, and the π-A isotherms were measured. The multilayer thin films were fabricated by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The structure of the multilayer thin films was investigated by UV-Vis spectra, X-ray diffraction, and FT-IR measurements. These LB films are rendered electrically conductive by doping with strong oxidizing agents such as NOPF6, I2, and SbCl5."
"Preparation and properties of novel oligo-acene Langmuir–Blodgett films without alkyl chain were investigated. Oligo-acene skeleton is used for the hydrophobic part, instead of conventional long alkyl chains, and substituted with weak hydrophilic groups at the 2- or 3-position. In addition to an amphiphilic balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the molecule, it was revealed that the number of aromatic rings and van der Waals cohesive forces in oligo-acene are crucial for stable monolayer formation. Tetracene-2,3-dialdehyde forms stable condensed monolayer on pure water subphase. This amphiphile gave a Z-type multilayer film on a hydrophilic substrate. The absorption spectra of the multilayer indicated large intermolecular π–π interaction between the neighboring amphiphiles."
"The behavior of monolayers of poly(amic acid) alkylamine salts containing different dimethylsiloxane chain lengths at the air−water interface was investigated. The limiting areas estimated from surface pressure−area isotherms were much larger than those calculated from both the alkyl chain number per repeating unit and the cross-sectional area of the alkyl chain. The direct observation of monolayers was carried out by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). The BAM observation was affected by the length of the dimethylsiloxane chain in the poly(amic acid)s. The layered structure of the LB films of poly(amic acid) alkylamine salts with multichains was investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared−reflection absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Consequently, it was found that the LB films consist of bilayer (Y-type) structures in which the alkyl chains are appreciably tilted from the normal direction and that the long dimethylsiloxane chain is concentrated in the outer surface of the LB films."
"An investigation of the retardation of the photo-isomerization ability of spiropyran in Langmuir-Blodgett films due to the introduction of SiO2 nanoparticles is reported. The thermal decoloration of merocyanine (PMC) open form to spiropyran (SP) closed form having a long alkyl chain was determined at 45°C and 60°C. SiO2 nanoparticles about 15 nm in diameter were adsorbed from the subphase onto a surface monolayer which consisted of SP mixed with arachidic acid at a molar ratio of 1:1. LB films composed of such a monolayer showed a retardation effect on PMC decoloration and an absorption peak blue shift. The reason for these changes might be attributed to the H-aggregate formation of SP molecules caused by the incorporation of SiO2 which restricted the molecular mobility."
"The behaviour and microstructure of the LB films of two C60 derivatives, dodecylaminofullerene (DAF) and polyhydroxydodecylaminofullerene (PHDAF), have been investigated. The π-A isotherms analysis indicates that the molecular aggregation of these compounds at the air-water interface is decreased compared with that of pure C60 because of appropriate chemical modification. The high-resolution transmission electron micrographs of the LB films showed up well-defined lattice fringes, which implies that the C60 moiety of DAF or PHDAF molecules form hexagonal stacked planar molecular crystals with two-dimensional structure."

"The mechanism of liquid crystal alignment on pyrolyzed polyimide Langmuir-Blodgett (PPI LB) films was investigated. Structural change of polyimide LB films caused by the pyrolysis was examined by monitoring the in-plane anisotropy of characteristics four vibrational bands. Before the pyrolysis, the polymer chain aligned preferentially along the dipping direction. The pyrolysis at 400°C caused the polymer chain to align more along the dipping direction. The C=O group of the imide ring was suggested to take a more random orientation after the heat treatment, which may be caused by the fission of the C-N bond of the imide ring. These four peaks disappeared when the pyrolyzing temperature was above 600°C. Microcrystals, several nm in size, were observed for a 201-layered PPI LB film pyrolyzed at 1000°C by TEM. The distribution of the lattice spacing and the distortion of the layered structure indicated the incomplete graphitization in the film, which was supported by the observed lattice spacings larger than 0.34 nm expected for a graphite. The molecular arrangement was suggested to be responsible for the liquid crystal alignment on the PPI LB films"
"An amphiphilic heteroaromatic styryl dye, 2-(4-dihexadecylaminostyryl)-1,5-dimethylpyrazinium iodide (I) was synthesized. Its Langmuir–Blodgett films fabricated from different subphases, namely pure water (Ia), 10−5 M CuCl2 (Ib), 10−5 M ZnCl2 (Ic) and 10−5 M HgCl2 (Id), were characterized by UV-Vis spectra and XPS measurements. The photoelectrochemistry of these film-modified conducting transparent indium–tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was investigated on a traditional three-electrode cell. The experimental data indicated that the films fabricated from different subphases have distinctive photoelectric responses. Under ambient conditions (0.5 M KCl), the quantum yields of photoelectric conversion were 0.03, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.1% for films Ia, Ib, Ic and Id, respectively. The effects of factors such as bias voltage, methylviologen (MV2+), and hydroquinone (H2Q) on the photocurrent generation were also investigated. Based on the experimental data, a possible mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer in this system is proposed."
"We report on novel investigations of non-linear optical 2-docosylamino-5-nitropyridine (DCANP) Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films by means of polarisation, second harmonic and scanning force microscopy (SFM). Direct optical measurements at the air/water interface showed that the molecules reoriented when depositing a LB film onto a solid substrate by the Langmuir-Blodgett method. Using the Langmuir-Schäfer method for horizontal dipping, however, resulted in the same surface structure being transferred onto substrates as was found for the DCANP film floating on a water subphase. Furthermore, the DCANP LB film was improved in film quality by adding 10-20% of arachidic acid (AA) to the pure DCANP phase. As shown by SFM, this results in a smooth surface structure free of defects while no significant changes in the optical properties of the mixed LB film were found. Such LB films therefore show improved structural and optical properties for optical wave guide applications. Additionally, a novel force microscope was set up which is able to image the conformation of the chromophores of a LB monolayer floating at the air/water interface. Combined operation of both this new force microscope and the optical methods offers the possibility for the simultaneous inspection of both the structural and optical properties of the floating Langmuir films down to the molecular scale."
"A new family of organometallic/inorganic hybrid Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, consisting of organometallic mercury acetylide (OMA) as the π-conjugated organometallic molecule and polyoxometallate (POM, POM = K5BW12O40 or Na5IMo6O24) of the Keggin and Anderson structures as the inorganic composite and docosanoic acid (DA) as the auxiliary film-forming agent, were prepared and well characterized by π–A isotherms, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra, atomic force microscopy imaging, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and low-angle X-ray diffraction. Our experimental results indicate that stable and well defined monolayer Langmuir and LB films are formed in pure water and POM subphases. There is a quenching effect in the luminescence intensity of the mercury complex when it is made into the LB films due to the enhanced aggregation phenomenon. These alkynylmercury(ii) based LB films exhibit interesting electrical conductivity behaviour, dependent of the characteristics of the POM used. They all reveal decent electrical conductivity, and the tunnelling current can reach ±100 nA when the voltage is set at –5 to +5 V."
"Non-centrosymmetric Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films have considerable potential for applications in second-order non-linear optics: the relevant lattice parameter, chi (2), is non-zero in a non-centrosymmetric environment. The precision with which LB multilayers can be built up allows fine control over the thickness and geometry of the film. Non-centrosymmetric LB films can be obtained by X- or Z-type deposition using a single-trough regime, or by Y-type deposition using troughs incorporating two different amphiphilic molecules. Five new amphiphilic dyes were used in the authors study of multilayer deposition for the production of organic LB multilayers for non-linear optics."
"This paper describes the preparation of a biomimetic Langmuir–Blodgett film of tyrosinase incorporated in a lipidic layer and the use of lutetium bisphthalocyanine as an electron mediator for the voltammetric detection of phenol derivatives, which include one monophenol (vanillic acid), two diphenols (catechol and caffeic acid) and two triphenols (gallic acid and pyrogallol). The first redox process of the voltammetric responses is associated with the reduction of the enzymatically formed o-quinone and is favoured by the lutetium bisphthalocyanine because significant signal amplification is observed, while the second is associated with the electrochemical oxidation of the antioxidant and occurs at lower potentials in the presence of an electron mediator. The biosensor shows low detection limit (1.98 × 10−6–27.49 × 10−6 M), good reproducibility, and high affinity to antioxidants (KM in the range of 62.31–144.87 μM). The excellent functionality of the enzyme obtained using a biomimetic immobilisation method, the selectivity afforded by enzyme catalysis, the signal enhancement caused by the lutetium bisphthalocyanine mediator and the increased selectivity of the curves due to the occurrence of two redox processes make these sensors exceptionally suitable for the detection of phenolic compounds."

"Metal alkanoates combine simple chemical structures and a versatility of condensed states of matter they exhibit. Solid crystals, plastic crystals, lyotropic and thermotropic ionic liquid crystals, liquids, mesomorphic glasses, and Langmuir–Blodgett films are just a few examples. Liquid crystal phases of metal alkanoates are the most intriguing because they represent a non-conventional class of materials known as ionic metallomesogens. Structural, thermal, and transport properties of mesomorphic metal alkanoates are well documented and reviewed. On the contrary, the optical and nonlinear-optical properties of these materials are very poorly understood. The situation has changed rapidly during the last decade. Advances in the design of mesomorphic glasses stable at room temperatures have launched a new era of research in the field of photonic and optoelectronic materials based on mesomorphic metal alkanoates. This manuscript reviews recent developments in the field of optical and nonlinear-optical materials based on mesomorphic metal alkanoates."
"We report in this work the isotherms of cholesterol and stearic acid at the air-water interface modified by different chitosans (chitosan chloride, hydrophobic modified chitosan, and medium and high molecular weight chitosans) in the aqueous subphase. The Langmuir-Blodgett films of the complexes cholesterol-chitosan and stearic acid-chitosan are analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and a molecular simulation was performed to visualize the chitosan-lipid interactions. Strong modifications are obtained in the isotherms as a result of the chitosan interactions with cholesterol and stearic acid at the air-water interface. These modifications were dependent on the type and concentration of chitosan. Severe modifications of all phases were noticed with larger molecular areas, and the observed changes in the compressional modulus were dependent on the type of chitosan used. The complexes of chitosan-stearic acid were more flexible than the ones of chitosan-cholesterol. The AFM images demonstrated that chitosan was disaggregated by the cholesterol and stearic acid interactions producing more homogeneous surfaces in some cases. The hydrophobic chitosan showed more affinity with stearic acid, while both medium and high molecular weight chitosans produced homogeneous surfaces with cholesterol. The simulated chitosan chains interacting with cholesterol and stearic acid demonstrated the possibility of specific sites of electrostatic bonds between these molecules. Adsorption of cholesterol on the different powdered chitosans, performed by HPLC, showed that the medium and high molecular weight chitosans could retain higher proportions of cholesterol compared with the other analyzed samples."
"Crystalline bacterial cell surface layers (S-layers) are the outermost cell envelope component of many eubacteria and archaeobacteria. S-layers are composed of a single protein or glycoprotein species and exhibit oblique, square or hexagonal lattice symmetry. Pores passing through these monomolecular arrays show identical size and morphology, and functional groups are aligned in well-defined positions and orientations. Due to these unique features, S-layers have broad application potential in biotechnology including functioning as biomimetic membranes. Presently, S-layers are used (i) for the production of isoporous ultrafiltration membranes with very well defined molecular sieving and adsorption properties, (ii) as matrices for the controlled immobilization of biologically active macromolecules (e.g., enzymes, antibodies, ligands) as required for biosensors, affinity membranes and affinity microparticles as well as for solid phase assays, (iii) as stabilizing structures for Langmuir-Blodgett films and liposomes and (iv) as carriers and adjuvants for weakly immunogenic antigens and haptens."

"Organic dyes show strong absorption bands in UV-visible spectral region. In organicdyes, excited electrons generated by an incident radiation return to the initial groundstates without emitting any light. On the other hand, rare earth metal ions displayphotoluminescence when their electrons are excited, though their quantum efficiencies arerather small. Interestingly, it we could hybridize organic dyes with rare metal ions thenthe photoluminescent intensity will be significantly enhanced, in which the energygenerated by the photoexcitation of a dye will be transferred to the rare metal ion.Furthermore, if we could introduce noncentrosymmetry in the molecular assemblies andfabricate a cavity with a mirror and a grating mirror at both edges of a device, theluminescent light will be amplified in the cavity to permitting laser light. Therefore, asecond harmonic light is then generated due to the noncentrosymmetric molecularassembly in the cavity. The second harmonic light can be emitted through the gratingmirror. We can classify this newly designed laser emitting device as one of the intelligentmaterials because it manifests simultaneously three fundamental functions: as a sensorresponding luminescent intensity, and an actuator for emitting shorter laser light.Therefore, this hybridization of organic dyes with rare metal ions offers multifunctionalnew devices."

They can be used as highinsulating ultra thin films and aligning layers in liquid crystal display devices. Inthose applications, it is necessary to directly observe the surface structures ofpolyimide LB films microscopically.

"Stable polyion-complexed polymeric monolayers were prepared by spreading perfluoroalkyl monomaleate copolymers, and , on a aqueous poly(allylamine) subphase. The monolayer properties have been studied by the surface pressure-area (-A) isotherms. The containing longer oligoethyleneglycol pendant showed more expanded monolayer phase than the . The polyion-complexed monolayers were transferable on various substrates, and the resulting Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-dimensional crosslinking to form a polymer network was achieved by amide formation through heat treatment under vacuum with concurrent removal of perfluoroalkyl tails. SEM observation of this film on a porous membrane filter showed that the four layer film was sufficiently stable to cover the filter pore size of 0.1 m. The revealed better covering capability than the . Immersion of this film in water or in benzene did not cause any change in its appearance and in Fl-IR spectra."
"[A biosensor chip aimed for the evaluation of the electrochemical effects of immobilization of enzymes was designed, fabricated and tested. The chip includes sensor structures for the potentiometric, amperometric and impedometric detection of biological reactions catalyzed by enzymes immobilized in the same manner, on the same substrate. The chip and its packaging were designed to allow different immobilization schemes to be used without chip design modification. A platinum micro-electrochemical electrode is used for the amperometric and impedometric detection. The potentiometric sensor is a differential pair, consisting of an ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) and an enzyme field effect transistor (ENFET). The n-channel ISFET and ENFET are fabricated in a p-well, with junction isolation from the solution. A photodefinable polyimide is used as an encapsulatant and to define the area of the platinum electrode. The sensor wafer is packaged by bonding a micromachined package wafer, which has holes etched to expose the active areas of the sensors and bond pads, on the surface of the sensor wafer. The bonded sensor die is mounted on a ceramic substrate to bring the leads out. The bond wires and pads and the edges of the die are encapsulated with a polyurethane encapsulant. The biosensor chip was evalu ated using the penicillin-penicillinase (EC 3.5.2.6) system. The penicillinase was immobilized by physical adsorption on a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film. The LB film, deposited from a pure water subphase, consisted of multilayers of pure docosanoic acid, or a few base layers of 22-tricosenoic acid and then docosanoic acid. A technique for the patterning of the LB films by a modified lift-off process was developed, so that the LB film only covers the active areas of the sensors. The penicillinase catalyzed reaction hydrolyses the penicillin into penicillinoic acid, which changes the local pH of the solution. The ENFET/ISFET differential potentiometric sensor showed a detection limit of 5 {dollar}{bsol}times{dollar} 10{dollar}{bsol}sp4{dollar} M penicillin-G in a 0.63 mM phosphate buffer solution. At high penicillin concentration, the penicillin-G overwhelmed the buffer in raising the pH of the solution, reducing the activity of penicillinase. The amperometric response showed a small penicillin-G concentration dependence because detecting hydrogen ions at a platinum electrode is very difficult, since the hydrolysis of water generates very large background noise. The impedometric detection showed a concentration dependent response in the phase angle of the electrode impedance at about 4 kHz, when the electrode was biased at +0.4 V versus a standard calomel electrode.]"

"The direct current (dc) conductivities and organic field-effect transistor (OFET) characteristics of a class of octa-substituted liquid crystalline (discotic mesophase) phthalocyanines (Pcs) are discussed. These molecules self-organize into columnar aggregates with large coherence lengths (up to approximately 300 nm). Langmuir–Blodgett films of these molecules were horizontally transferred to either interdigitated microelectrodes (IME) or OFET substrates, so that current flow could be measured either parallel or perpendicular to the column axis. Twenty-eight bilayer films of these Pcs on the IME substrates showed anisotropies in dc conductivity up to 50:1, whereas similar Pc films showed anisotropies in field effect mobilities of approximately 10:1, for a variety of W/L ratios (source/drain dimensions and spacing). Field-effect mobilities of 1 to 5 × 10 -6 cm 2 ·V -1 ·s -1 were determined from OFET measurements, along the Pc column axis, whereas charge mobilities measured from the space charge limited current regime on the IME substrates were in the range of 10 -4 cm 2 ·V -1 ·s -1 . Conductive tip atomic force microscopy measurements on the apprximately 500-nm length scale showed that the conductivity anisotropy can be as high as 1000:1 when the Pc columns are intimately contacted to an adjacent Au bond pad."

After transfer on solid supports, the films were investigated by atomic force microscopy.

The Langmuir trough study of this new fullerene derivative indicates that floating film could form monomolecular thick film at the air/water interface at lower concentration, and can be well transferred the floating mixed CB and arachidic acid film onto substrates using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. In the case of the mixed film, high quality films with thickness of up to 50 layers could be readily built up. The absorption variation with film thickness at 255nm was measured, indicating good LB deposition up to 50 layers."

"Poly( p -phenylene benzobisthiazole) (PBT) has received a strong attention as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material because of its large, ultrafast NLO response 1 and inherently superior physical and chemical properties 2 . However, the material is difficult to process into thin film with good optical quality, which hindered the detailed and accurate NLO studies. In order to improve optical quality, the PBT Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films were fabricated via a novel precursor route. The PBT LB films show not only improved optical quality but also highly in-plane oriented molecular packing. Because the π-electrons are delocalized along the polymer chain direction, the highly oriented packing of the polymer chains results in linear and NLO anisotropy properties. Therefore, in-plane anisotropy measurement of optical third-harmonic generation (THG) is one of the powerful tools to elucidate the packing arrangement in LB films of one-dimensional conjugated system."
"The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is used to determine the phase transition point of thin films by measuring the change in frequency as a function of temperature. To elucidate this relationship, two types of polymers were studied where the bulk phase transitions were known. We investigated a casted thin film of an amphiphilic polyoxazoline and a Langmuir-Blodgett film comprised of fifteen double layers of an amphotropic polyacrylate. The phase transition points of the thin films could be detected by the QCM which were in the same range as for the bulk materials."
"Langmuir films of the title compound, 2,4-bis[4-(dibutylamino)phenyl]squaraine, Sq0, and its substituted analogues, Sq1 (monohydroxy) to Sq4 (tetrahydroxy), exhibit three well defined phases at the air–water interface: λmax 525–550 nm (H-aggregate); 660–670 nm (intermediate); 760–770 nm (J-aggregate). The monolayer spectra are influenced by the surface pressure and the number of hydroxy substituents and, when the monolayers are transferred to a solid substrate, there is a correlation between the linear and non-linear optical behaviour of the Langmuir-Blodgett films. Second-harmonic generation has been observed even though the unit molecular structures of two analogues, Sq0 and Sq4, are centric. The behaviour is aggregation-induced and there is evidence that the dyes associate in dilute solution. The electrospray ionization mass spectra exhibit peaks with high mass/charge (m/z) ratios; the data conform to the dimeric aggregate and, for solutions of two or more squaraines, corroborate the existence of heteromolecular associates."
"Langmuir monolayers made from peptide-lipid molecules represent a novel direction in the research areas of biomimetic interfaces and two-dimensional supramolecular chemistry. Peptide structures and molecular recognition activities toward other guest molecules have been the focus of previous study. This study reports the investigation of metal complexation to histidine-containing peptide lipids in the organized Langmuir, Langmuir-Schaefer, or Langmuir-Blodgett films. Three peptide lipids PEP1-PEP3, with a histidine amino acid incorporated in the middle of the peptide, were designed and synthesized. The monolayer structures and metal-binding activities of each peptide lipid and their 1:1:1 molar ratio mixture were studied by thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques. It was found that hard Lewis acid type metal cations such as K+ and Mg2+, and borderline or soft metal cations such as Zn2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ exhibit clearly different binding activity toward peptide-lipid monolayers. The conformational changes of peptides upon binding with Cu2+ and Zn2+ were partially revealed by FT-IR spectroscopic studies. Furthermore, by adding a fluorescent-probe lipid to the peptide monolayer, dramatic fluorescence change was observed when Cu2+ or Zn2+ bound to the Langmuir and Langmuir-Schaefer films of peptide-lipid monolayers. Metal-protein complexation plays a crucial role in the function and activity of proteins and enzymes. Investigation of metal complexation to organized peptide Langmuir monolayers may provide an alternative approach for the development of artificial metalloproteins and novel supramolecular systems or materials."
"Langmuir films behavior of asymmetric glycerol dialkyl nonitol tetraether (GDNT) lipids at the air-water interface (temperature 19℃ ± 1℃) investigated the stability of the mean ratio of Langmuir films for different spreading time prior to the transfer film. Floating monolayer films stability is an important parameter to obtain high-quality Langmuir-Blodgett films for their aplications. Hysteresis loop of the compression-decompression (μ-A) isotherms of Langmuir film GDNT used to analyze the thermodynamic stability of the monolayer films and its features. Langmuir films stability of tetraether lipid GDNT shown more stable at the time of spreading longer than a short time."
"Humankind's curiosity for very small objects (i.e., nanomaterials) existed long before the term "nanotechnology" became so popular. Several pioneering conceptual proposals including those by Richard Feynman and Kim Eric Drexler, accompanied by various technology developments, such as high-resolution microscopes and advanced fabrication techniques, have promoted continuous growth of research activities focusing on nanoscale dimensions. It is true that nanotechnology is important. At least, all materials scientists at the present time claim this. However, we may have some doubts as to whether nanotechnology is really a satisfactory concept for recent developments on functional advanced materials or not. Fabrication of advanced materials may not be done only with simple techniques, such as atomic/molecular manipulation and/or high-resolution microscopy. Constructing functional materials from nanoscale objects is indeed a complicated process. Phenomena on the nanoscale are highly influenced by thermal/statistical fluctuations and mutual interactions between components, and they are not always expected. We cannot simply summarize either independent cause and effect or input and output in nanoscale fabrication. Instead we must harmonize them. This strategy cannot be regarded as a simple technology. A more advanced concept, architectonics, has to be applied. As a novel concept coming next to nanotechnology, nanoarchitectonics has now to be emphasized for facile development of functional systems and advanced materials. The concept of nanoarchitectonics was first proposed by Masakazu Aono at the International Symposium on Nanoarchitectonics in 2000. According to this concept, advanced materials can be designed through the harmonization of atomic/molecular-level control, chemical nanofabrication, self- and field-controlled organization, and theoretical modeling. These working principles can be applicable to all categories of materials, regardless of material types, including inorganic, organic, and biomaterials. This wide applicability of the nanoarchitectonics concept can be seen in the variety of research topics published in this special issue. These research topics can be roughly categorized into: i) nanomaterials and nano-objects (graphitic nanocarbon, clay nanotubes, nanowire heterojunctions, nanomotors, upconverting nanoparticles, colloidal nanocrystals and metal nanoparticles; ii) fundamental chemistry and physics (dynamic functions from atom to macro, mechanoresponsive luminescence, chiral twists and helices, oriented self-assembly, and synthesis in ionic liquids); and iii) biological study and biomedical application (cellulose-rich nanofibers, organelle mimics of soft matter, biomimetic light-harvesting, drug carriers, hemoglobin-based nanoarchitectures, cancer treatment and diagnosis, and nonviral delivery of nucleic acids). In order to establish a milestone step in materials science, we realize a clear paradigm shift from nanotechnology to nanoarchitectonics in the top materials journal, Advanced Materials, with highest quality contributions here realized as a milestone issue, Nanoarchitectonics for Advanced Materials: A Strategy Beyond Nanotechnology. We are most grateful for the invaluable support and professional editing from the whole editorial team of Advanced Materials, in particular Dr. Emily Hu and Dr. Lorna M. Stimson. Katsuhiko Ariga received his Ph.D. degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. He is currently the Director of the Supermolecules Group and Principal Investigator of the World Premier International (WPI) Research Centre for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS). His research is oriented toward supramolecular chemistry, surface science, and functional nanomaterials (Langmuir–Blodgett film, layer-by-layer assembly, self-organized materials, sensing and drug delivery, molecular recognition, mesoporous materials, etc.). He is now trying to combine them into one unified field for world-surprise. Junbai Li obtained his Ph.D. degree in polymer science from Jilin University.

"The recent use of scanning probe microscopy has gone beyond basic structural measurements to studies of -processes including self-assembled monolayer growth, phase transitions in Langmuir-Blodgett films and morphological transformations in surfactant interfacial aggregates. Also, the influence of the probe itself on film structure was demonstrated in experiments that showed tip-induced changes to molecular packing and orientation."
"The triplet state behavior of carbazole-containing polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films was investigated. The carbazole groups are localized at the hydrophobic part of the layered film and form a triplet excimer which is attributed to interlayer interaction at the interfaces between layers. The degree of interaction between carbazole chromophores in the triplet state is determined by the interchromophore distance."
"Conventional Raman measurements of dyes in the visible region exhibit resonant effects which enhance the Raman scattering cross-section of the chromophores by several orders of magnitude but make scattering from other parts of the molecules, such as the hydrocarbon chains, unobservable. Taking advantage of the benefits inherent to Fourier transform (FT) spectroscopy, Raman spectra can now be measured routinely with an FT IR spectrometer and a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser. By coupling the laser excitation into a thin film waveguide, we have recently observed FT Raman spectra of a thin film of polystyrene. The advantages of using integrated optics with FT Raman spectroscopy for Langmuir-Blodgett films of dye molecules are also discussed."
